/**
 * Turning Playwright's aria snapshot into the flat element list the tool contract publishes.
 *
 * Playwright's `mode: "ai"` output is YAML: each entry is a mapping whose key describes the element
 * and whose value is that control's contents. A YAML parser preserves quoted values, colons, escaped
 * quotes, multi-line values and deeper indentation.
 *
 * Parsed under the failsafe schema, which resolves every scalar as a string. What a control contains
 * is text, and nothing here wants it typed.
 *
 * What remains to parse by hand is one descriptor per element,
 * `textbox "Customer name:" [ref=e5] [checked]`, and that is scanned rather than matched, because the
 * parts can contain one another: an accessible name can hold a bracket and a flag can hold a quote.
 *
 * This module has no Playwright import, so parser tests do not need a browser.
