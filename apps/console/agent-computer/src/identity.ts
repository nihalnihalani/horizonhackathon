/**
 * This computer's own identity, asked of the local SPIRE agent.
 *
 * No identity is baked in. There is no key in the image and no secret in the environment: the computer
 * asks the agent over a unix socket, and the agent decides what it is by inspecting the container the
 * request came from and matching the label the supervisor set when it created it. So a computer
 * cannot claim to be a Bot it is not, and an unregistered container is issued nothing, which is
 * the property that makes this worth more than a name in a header.
 *
 * The `spiffe` package rather than a hand-rolled gRPC client: it is the maintained Node client for
 * the Workload API and gets the streaming semantics right.
 *
 * A deployment without SPIRE gets `null` and carries on. Identity is available where the deployment
 * supports it, not a condition of the computer running.
