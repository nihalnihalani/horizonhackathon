 * later (#62) and was never wired to the wheel, so a Bot could run a command and rewrite the
 * workspace underneath somebody mid-sign-in.
 *
 * The list lives here, beside the other path decision, rather than in `index.ts`, for the reason the
 * header of this file gives: a decision next to `chromium.launch()` cannot be tested without Chrome.
 *
 * Reading is not acting. `/files/read` and `/files/list` stay open so a Bot waiting to be handed the
 * wheel back can still say what it was doing.
