/**
 * How many browsers one computer holds, and for how long.
 *
 * There was no answer to either. A context was started the first time each Bot was used and kept,
 * and the only things that dropped one were an explicit stop, a browser that had already died, and
 * shutdown. A deployment where every employee has a Bot trends toward one resident Chromium per
 * employee in a single container, at a few hundred MB each, until it is killed for memory and
 * relaunches its way back to the same state.
 *
 * Closing one loses nothing: the profile is on disk, so the Bot's logins survive and its next
 * request starts where it left off. That is already what `stop` means here.
 *
 * These test the decision rather than the closing. `createProfiles` launches a real Chromium, so a
 * test that went through it would be testing Playwright; the part with a wrong answer available is
 * which browser gets picked.
