 * The wheel, tested on both paths.
 *
 * This is the piece standing between two drivers and one page, and until now it had no tests at all, * it lived as a `let` inside the file that imports playwright, so a test could not reach it without
 * launching Chrome. What is checked here is mostly the refusal path, because that is where this
 * component earns its keep: a Bot clicking while a person types, a secret typed when nothing asked for
 * one, a request answered twice, a handover that leaves a password box open behind it.
 *
 * A fake clock is injected so `since` can be asserted rather than shrugged at.
