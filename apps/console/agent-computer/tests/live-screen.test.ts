/**
 * The live screen, driven against the real process with a real browser.
 *
 * `viewer.test.ts` covers who owns the screen and what that lets them do, and it cannot cover
 * whether the handlers ask. That gap is the whole of this bug: every failure here reads as correct
 * in a unit test of the decision, because the decision was never the part that was wrong. So this
 * one imports `index.ts`, opens real sockets against the port it listens on, and lets it launch
 * Chromium.
 *
 * ASKED FOR BY NAME, like `tests/smoke/journey.test.ts`, and for a related reason. `index.ts` imports
 * Playwright at module scope, `playwright` is declared only in this directory's own `package.json`,
 * and CI installs the root workspaces plus the two Bots and never this one. An ungated file would
 * therefore throw on import there, and `bun run test:ci` asserts a floor on the number of tests
 * executed, so that failure reddens the build rather than skipping quietly. Reading the flag before
 * the dynamic import below is what keeps the default suite honest on a machine where Playwright was
 * never installed:
 *
 *   bun run test:live-screen
 *
 * Everything here is timing against a browser that has to start, so the waits are generous. They are
 * not the thing under test; what is under test is whether anything relaunches a browser nobody asked
 * to start, and whether input reaches a page it does not belong to.
