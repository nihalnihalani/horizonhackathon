"""CrewAI as a Bot.

The third harness in the box, and the first built the way every one after it will be: the AG-UI
integration that CrewAI's own ecosystem publishes, mounted on FastAPI, with nothing of the protocol
written here. `agent-bot` and `agent-langgraph` speak AG-UI by hand because they predate the rule
that we do not write adapters. This one imports `ag_ui_crewai` and stops.

The contract with the rest of OpenBot is the same one the other Bots meet, and it is small:
serve AG-UI on a port, answer `/health`, and refuse anybody who does not carry the server's token.

    is why nothing here touches a key.

    The model half is whatever the endpoint publishes, slashes included. litellm takes the first

    OpenAI-compatible endpoint is `openai/qwen/qwen3-8b`, and `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` is
    `openai/openai/gpt-5.6-terra`. Treating a slash as "already a provider" dropped the prefix,
