/**
 * Serve the built app, and pass its API calls to the server.
 *
 * NOT VITE. `vite preview` was doing this, run through `bun --bun` so that a machine with bun and
 * no Node could start it at all, and the combination is broken in a way that looks like the whole
 * product failing: Vite's proxy calls `socket.destroySoon()` when an upstream response ends, bun's
 * sockets do not implement it, and the process dies with `TypeError: socket.destroySoon is not a
 * function` on the FIRST call the app makes. So the app served its page, died, and the shell's
 * window went on saying "OpenBot is running" with nothing on the port. Measured on a real install.
 *
 * A development server was never the right thing to run in an installed application, which is what
 * the shell's own comment about this process already said. This serves a directory and forwards one
 * prefix, needs no Node, and has nothing in it that a dev server needs and an install does not.
