 * Only for a coworker that runs somewhere else. The Bot in the box has no endpoint and nothing to
 * authenticate as, and offering it a token would imply otherwise.
 *
 * Shown once, and said plainly. This deployment keeps a hash, so there is no screen that can show the
 * token again: an operator who loses it rotates, and rotating retires the old one, which is also how a
 * leak is handled.
 *
 * A coworker with no token can still hold a conversation. What it cannot do is reach anything outside
 * one, which is the right default for a URL somebody pasted.
