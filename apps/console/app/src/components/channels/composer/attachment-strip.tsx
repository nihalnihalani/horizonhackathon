/**
 * WHAT IS ON THE COMPOSER, DRAWN AS ITS OWN ROW ACROSS THE TOP.
 *
 * `PromptArea` will draw this strip itself, given `images` and `files`, and it did until this
 * existed. Three things were wrong with that, and all three come from the same fact: the strip is
 * inside the editor's column, and on the compact composer that column is the MIDDLE of a row whose
 * first child is the attach button.
 *
 * So the strip started 42px in from the composer's left edge, hanging off nothing, instead of
 * lining up with the frame the way every reference composer draws it. Its thumbnails are a
 * hardcoded `h-16 w-16` with no prop to say otherwise. And its padding is a hardcoded `pb-2`,
 * which this file previously reached in and overrode by class name.
 *
 * Each of those could be forced from outside with a selector into somebody else's DOM, and for a
 * while one of them was. Three of them stacked is a component we have forked in CSS without saying
 * so, and it breaks silently on the next `prompt-area` release. Fifty lines of our own markup is
 * the cheaper of the two.
 *
 * Both composer branches use this, so there is one strip in the app rather than a compact one and
 * a full-size one that drift.
