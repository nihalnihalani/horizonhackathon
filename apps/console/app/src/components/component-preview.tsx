 *
 * It is measured against both axes, because a component's height is its own business: a donut chart
 * and a five-line checklist are the same width and nothing like the same height. Fitting on width
 * alone left the tall ones running out of the bottom of the tile.
 *
 * Never scaled past its natural size, then held to `fill` of what it could fill. A box wider than a
 * conversation column would otherwise magnify a component beyond the size anybody will actually see
 * it at.
 *
