 * The answers a Bot can give, drawn rather than described.
 *
 * Somebody meeting this product asks one question first: what does an answer look like? A list of
 * names answers it for nobody, and a screenshot ages the moment a component changes. So every tile
 * is the real component, rendered from the arguments it ships as its own introduction: the actual
 * donut, the actual line chart, the actual card that waits for an answer.
 *
 * What is shown is what the Bot was granted, not what the build contains. A component can be
 * unpublished, or held back from this Bot, and showing it anyway would be advertising something the
 * person cannot have.
 *
 * The tiles are quiet on purpose. Every one of them is a different shape, colour and density, and
 * the eye should land on those rather than on frames we drew around them: one hairline, one label,
 * and the component left to be the interesting thing.
