 * pages with no container at all, four heading sizes, four padding schemes, and a sidebar 20px wider
 * than the rest of the app. Three of those pages imported nothing from `components/ui` and drew
 * their own buttons, inputs and tables. The result did not read as a different screen, it read as a
 * different application — which is the impression an administrator forms at exactly the moment they
 * are deciding whether to trust it with credentials.
 *
 * The shape was never in doubt: Skills and Settings already had it. So this is that shape, extracted
 * once and used everywhere, INCLUDING by Skills and Settings. Leaving those two as hand-written
 * copies would mean three dialects rather than two, and the next screen somebody writes copies
 * whichever it happened to see first.
