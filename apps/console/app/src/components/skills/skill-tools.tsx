/**
 * Which tools this skill says it needs.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS THAT THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Selection is over skills: before a run the deployment asks
 * its own model which skills the message needs, and the Bot is built with those skills' tools plus
 * every granted tool no skill claims. A deployment where no skill declares anything has nothing to
 * select on, so every Bot is offered its whole catalogue — which is the case the narrowing was built
 * to fix. Until this screen existed the only way to declare a tool was to call the API by hand.
 *
 * A DECLARATION IS NOT A GRANT, and this is the one thing the screen has to get across. Anybody
 * signed in may write a skill; adding an MCP server is an administrator's decision. If naming a tool
 * here made it callable, the first surface would be a way around the second. It does not: the offer
 * is intersected with what the Bot was granted, so a skill naming a tool its Bot does not hold
 * selects the skill and loads nothing. Said in the hint rather than left for somebody to discover,
 * because the failure it prevents is somebody ticking boxes expecting access.
 *
 * PART OF THE FORM, unlike the Agents toggles below it. What a skill needs is the author's draft
 * until they press save, so unticking one and closing the panel changes nothing. Granting is the
 * opposite and saves on press, which is why the two look different on purpose.
