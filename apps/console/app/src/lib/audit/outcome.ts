/**
 * Whether a row in the trail is something this deployment turned away, something that was allowed
 * and then did not happen, or something that went through.
 *
 * THE TWO PLACES THAT DECIDE THIS HAVE TO BE ONE PLACE. The audit page asks the question twice: once
 * to colour and label a row, and once to build the `eventType` list behind the `Blocked` and
 * `Did not happen` saved views. They were two hand-written lists, and they had already drifted — a
 * refusal missing from the first is drawn as "Allowed", a refusal missing from the second is
 * missing from the view somebody clicks to ask what this deployment refused, and neither omission
 * says anything. So the lists live here, the page derives both from them, and a new refusal is added
 * in one place or in none.
 *
 * WHY "ALLOWED" IS THE ONE WRONG ANSWER. The page falls back to it for anything it does not
 * recognise, which is the right default for the many rows that are neither a refusal nor a failure —
 * a credential saved, a component published, a person's role changed. For a refusal it is not a
 * missing label, it is the opposite of what happened, on the screen an administrator opens to find
 * out what happened. A trail that is confidently wrong is worse than a silent one.
