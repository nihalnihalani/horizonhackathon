/**
 * The thread the direct Bot chat talks in.
 *
 * Two things it has to be. Minted by this deployment, so the conversation says where it came from
 * in a project that may hold more than one. And the same one tomorrow, because a chat that takes a
 * new thread on every load has no history to come back to.
 *
 * Kept per Bot: the chat is bound to one Bot at a time, and two Bots sharing a thread would read
 * each other's conversation.
 *
 * "Tomorrow" is a promise this module cannot keep on its own, though. The id survives in
 * `localStorage` forever, but Intelligence is free to forget the thread behind it — expiry,
 * environment reset, a wiped dev database. Remembering an id nobody upstream recognises does not
 * fail loudly: every send just opens a new, empty thread under the old id, and the chat answers as
 * if nothing had ever been said, with no error on screen to explain why. So before this hook hands
 * out a remembered id, it asks Intelligence whether that id still means something, and only keeps
 * pretending the history is there when the answer says it is.
