/**
 * Making a coworker from inside a conversation.
 *
 * The deployment ships a skill called `bot-creator` whose instruction is how to interview somebody
 * about the coworker they want. These four tools are what let that interview end in a coworker
 * rather than in a wall of text somebody has to retype into a form: three reads so the Bot can see
 * what already exists and what it may put on the new one, and one write that suspends the run on a
 * card.
 *
 * WHY THE BROWSER AND NOT THE SERVER. A coworker is created as a person, not as a Bot: it goes on
 * their roster under their name, and whether they may make one is a question about them. `POST
 * /api/agents` already answers exactly that, and writes the `bot.created` audit row with the actor
 * on it, so a tool riding the signed-in session inherits every bit of that unchanged. A server-side
 * tool would have to carry an actor into runs that do not always have one — a routine, a Slack
 * thread, a schedule — and the first way that goes wrong is a coworker created under the wrong name,
 * on a roster nobody chose. Nothing is lost by it living here: making a coworker is an interview, so
 * there is nobody to interview where there is no browser.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE GATED ON THE GRANT. Four more tools on every run is not free — a model picks the
 * right tool reliably out of about ten, which is the whole reason per-run narrowing exists — and a
 * Bot for looking up transactions has no business making coworkers. So the gate is the ordinary one:
 * the Bot has to hold the `bot-creator` skill, granted the same way everything else is.
