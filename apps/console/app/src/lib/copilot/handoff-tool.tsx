 * How a Bot handing work to another Bot reads in the transcript.

 * nothing here registers a tool or decides anything. What it registers is a line, because a hop that
 * happens off-screen is the thing the issue asks to avoid: a conversation that quietly fans out to
 * four Bots and bills for all of them should say so while it is doing it.
 *
 * Without this the call still appears, as a generic tool call named `message_bot` with its arguments
 * as JSON. That is technically visible and practically not: the point is that a person can see their
 * Bot bringing in another one and read what it asked for.
