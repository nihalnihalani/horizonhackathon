/**
 * The messages a thread already holds, for restoring a conversation somebody comes back to.
 *
 * A plain fail-closed function rather than a query. Nothing caches it — the transcript this seeds is
 * then owned by the running agent, so a cached copy would be a second version of the same
 * conversation — and an unreadable history is not a reason to keep somebody from typing. Every
 * failure returns nothing and lets the composer open.
 *
 * WHAT ARRIVES HERE IS NOT TRUSTED. This used to end `stored as Message[]`, which is a cast rather
 * than a check: whatever the history store held was handed to `setMessages` and then to every
 * projection that reads a transcript. A turn shaped differently reached a renderer that dereferenced
 * `toolCall.function.arguments` and took the whole conversation down with it. One bad turn made a
 * thread unreadable.
 *
 * So each turn is parsed against the schema AG-UI ships, and one that does not parse is left out.
 * Checked here rather than in a projection because there are several projections and one history:
 * fixing it in the reader that is closest to the wire is what makes every consumer safe at once.
 *
 * BUT `{id, name, args}` IS NOT A CORRUPTION, AND TREATING IT AS ONE DELETED REAL WORK. That shape
 * was read as damage from an interrupted run and dropped. It is how the runtime persists every tool
 * call it stores, so dropping it meant every turn in which a Bot used a tool vanished on reload: the
 * transcript kept the sentence the Bot wrote and lost the browsing that produced it, the inline
 * screen went with it, and the footer said some messages could not be read. Observed against a live
 * thread, where every browsing turn was counted unreadable and every one of them was well formed in
 * the store's own dialect.
 *
 * So it is translated rather than refused. The check stays for turns that really are malformed; a
 * reader is entitled to insist on one shape, but not to throw away the history because the writer
 * spells it another way.
 */

 * What a read gives back: the turns that parsed, and how many did not.

 * with nothing to say otherwise. The caller is expected to say so on screen.
