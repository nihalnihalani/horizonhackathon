/**
 * A WebSocket's address, same-origin unless a Vite runtime says otherwise.
 *
 * In production the server serves the app and answers the `/api` WebSocket upgrade on the same
 * origin, so the browser's own host is the target — including behind an ingress that terminates TLS
 * on 443 and never exposes the container's port. Deriving the socket from `window.location` is the
 * standard shape for a reverse-proxied deployment, and it is the default here because it is the case
 * that must not break.
 *
 * Development and the desktop's `vite preview` are the exception. There Vite serves the app on
 * APP_PORT and proxies `/api` to the server on SERVER_PORT, a different origin, and under bun that
 * proxy cannot carry a WebSocket at all (oven-sh/bun#24127): the upgrade is answered with a plain
 * HTTP response and the socket never opens. So those two runtimes address the server directly, by
 * the port each announces on `window.__OPENBOT_WS_PORT__`. Nothing announces it in the built bundle
 * the server hands out, so a production page has no port to override with and stays same-origin.
