 * `afterEach`, matching `agent-roster-error.test.tsx`: bun walks every file into one process, and a
 * document another file tore down mid-run fails invisibly.
 *
 * The registration carries a `url` for the reason `composer-attachments-ui.test.tsx` records:
 * without one `location` is `about:blank` and a thumbnail's relative `src` does not resolve.
