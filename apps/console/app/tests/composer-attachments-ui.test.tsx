 * update in a world with no `window`. That is the ` 1 error` this suite used to print next to 0
 * failures.
 *
 * Send is the part of the screen that knows the difference. `canSendDraft` holds the button shut
 * while any attachment is still `uploading`, so a Send that has come back on is an upload that has
 * been answered and a composer that has re-rendered on the answer. It is also FALSE when the wait
