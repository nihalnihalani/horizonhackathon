/**
 * WHEN THE BOX MEASURES THE THING IT IS ABOUT TO ANIMATE, AND WHEN IT REFUSES TO.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S. `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll` and `cleanup` in
 * `afterEach`, matching `agent-roster-error.test.tsx`: bun walks every file into one process, and a
 * document another file tore down mid-run fails invisibly. The registration carries a `url` for the
 * reason `composer-attachments-ui.test.tsx` records.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS WATCH THE MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN THE HEIGHT ON SCREEN. There is no height on
 * screen to watch. `motion` binds its frame loop at import time, and every module in this suite is
 * imported before `GlobalRegistrator.register()` has put a `window` in the world, so motion's
 * animated values are never written to the DOM here: the box reports `height: 0px` forever no
 * matter what it was told to animate to. What IS observable is the only thing this component reads
 * from the DOM — `offsetHeight` on the content — and reading it is not incidental, it is the whole
 * act of taking a measurement. Counting those reads is counting the decisions the component made.
