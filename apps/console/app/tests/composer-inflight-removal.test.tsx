/**
 * A CHIP REMOVED WHILE ITS UPLOAD IS STILL IN THE AIR, WHICH USED TO LEAVE A ROW NOBODY COULD SEE.
 *
 * `removeAttachment` drops the SDK's placeholder. The upload it belonged to is mid-flight, so when
 * it lands the SDK writes its answer onto a placeholder that no longer exists and the write is a
 * no-op — but the row is on the server by then, in THIS composer's `uploadGroup`, which is minted
 * once per mount and lives as long as the composer does. The screen counts seven, the server counts
 * eight, and the next pick comes back `409 You already have 8 attachments waiting to send in this
 * channel.` naming files that are on nobody's screen. That is verbatim the failure `uploadGroup`
 * was introduced to remove, reached through a Remove button rather than through a closed tab.
 *
 * The composer cannot ask "was my chip removed?" at the moment the upload lands: `onUpload` is
 * handed a `File` and the SDK never says which placeholder the call belongs to. So it reconciles
 * instead — every row it uploaded against every row still drawn — and these tests drive that from
 * both sides, because a reconciler that deletes too much is worse than the leak it replaces.
 *
 * A HARNESS OF ITS OWN RATHER THAN `composer-attachment-lifecycle.test.tsx`'s, for two reasons that
 * file's fixture cannot give: an upload that can be RELEASED on demand rather than merely held
 * open forever, and a distinct server id per file, since the whole question here is which row was
 * given back. That file answers `stored-id` to everything, which cannot tell two rows apart.
 *
 * `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll` and `cleanup` in `afterEach` is this repository's
 * pattern, because bun walks every file into one process and a document another file tore down
 * mid-run fails invisibly. The registration carries a `url` because without one `location` is
 * `about:blank` and the relative upload URL does not resolve.
