/**
 * THE COMPOSER ON A DEPLOYMENT THAT IS NOT A SECURE CONTEXT.
 *
 * `crypto.randomUUID` is a secure-context-only API. `http://localhost` is one, which is why a
 * laptop never sees this; a deployment reached at plain `http://<address>` is not, and the property
 * is simply ABSENT there — so the call does not degrade, it throws a `TypeError`. `lib/new-id.ts`
 * exists for that reason alone and `new-id.test.ts` pins the function itself.
 *
 * These pin the CALLERS, which is the half that was wrong. Three id-minting sites in this composer
 * called `crypto.randomUUID` directly, and all three are on the path that reports a refusal — so on
 * an http deployment the composer's answer to a bad file was to break in a different way each time
 * and say nothing at all. Every test below removes the function, exactly as that deployment does,
 * and asserts the sentence still arrives.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DONE HERE AND NOT WITH A MOCK. The throw has to come from the real call site inside the
 * real render, because what made this dangerous was never the id: it was where the throw landed —
 * inside `screenPickedFiles` (taking the whole screening pass), inside the SDK's per-file upload
 * loop, and inside a `useEffect` (taking the tree). A stub that returns a fake id would test the
 * stub.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S, matching `composer-attachment-lifecycle.test.tsx` —
 * `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll` and `cleanup` in `afterEach`, because bun walks
 * every file into one process and a document another file tore down mid-run fails invisibly. The
 * registration carries a `url` because without one `location` is `about:blank` and the relative
 * upload URL does not resolve.
