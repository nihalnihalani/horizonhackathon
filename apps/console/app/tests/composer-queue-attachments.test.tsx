/**
 * WHAT THE QUEUE DOES TO AN ATTACHMENT BEHIND SOMEBODY'S BACK, AT BOTH ENDS OF THE SAME ROW.
 *
 * The first half of the file is the composer handing a staged attachment TO the queue. The second
 * half — from `ConversationView` down — is the queue handing one back, and what has to happen to
 * the server-side row when it does. The last test is about the instrument rather than the code.
 *
 * The queue branch used to call the SDK's `consumeAttachments()`, which sweeps every `ready`
 * attachment regardless of which one a send already in flight is riding — so parking a
 * correction while a first send was still out took the first send's own attachment with it, and
 * the composer's own comment ("the catch hands them straight back") went false the moment a
 * queue happened mid-send. The fix removes only what `onQueue` is actually taking.
 *
 * WHY THE FIRST TEST SPIES ON THE SDK HOOK RATHER THAN DRIVING AN ACTUAL FAILED SEND. The
 * regression only shows up on screen once `sending` stops hiding the riding attachment, and the
 * only two things that clear `sending` are a successful send — whose own `finally` removes the
 * riding ids explicitly either way, masking the bug — and a failed one, whose `catch` this suite
 * cannot reach: `submitDraft`'s rejection reaches both call sites (`handleFormSubmit`'s form
 * submit and prompt-area's own Enter-key call) as a voided promise neither awaits nor catches,
 * so bun's test runner reports the resulting unhandled rejection as a failure of whichever test
 * is running when it surfaces — see `composer-attachment-lifecycle.test.tsx`'s second test for
 * this repository's own note on the same wall. What is reachable, and what the fix actually
 * changes, is which SDK function the queue branch calls — `consumeAttachments()` (sweeps every
 * `ready` attachment) versus `removeAttachment()` per id (surgical) — so this spies on both,
 * wrapping the real hook rather than replacing it, and asserts on the calls directly.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S. `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll` and `cleanup`
 * in `afterEach`, matching `composer-attachment-lifecycle.test.tsx` for the reason recorded
 * there: bun walks every file into one process, and a document another file tore down mid-run
 * fails invisibly. The registration carries a `url` because without one `location` is
 * `about:blank` and the relative URLs every one of these requests uses do not resolve.

 * this file cares about are intercepted, on their way to doing the real thing regardless.
 *
 * `spyOn` ON THE MODULE NAMESPACE, NOT `mock.module`, BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THE TWO COMES BACK OFF.
 * Both reach composer.tsx — its `import { useAttachments }` is a live binding, so a patch applied
 * here lands even though that import already ran. The difference is the undo. Bun has no way to
 * unregister a module mock: `mock.restore()` leaves one in place, so the honest reading of what
 * this file used to do in `afterAll` — call `mock.module` a second time with a spread snapshot —
 * is that it installed a PERMANENT mock rather than restoring anything, and every test file bun
 * walked into the same process afterwards imported that snapshot instead of the package. A
 * namespace spy is restorable, and `afterAll` genuinely puts the real function back.
 *
 * THE TWO WRAPPERS ARE MEMOISED, and that is not tidiness. The SDK builds both of these as
 * `useCallback(…, [])` — they are stable for the life of the hook, deliberately — and composer.tsx
 * depends on that: `submitDraft` lists `removeAttachment` in its dependency array, and every
 * prompt-area callback hangs off `submitDraft`. Minting fresh wrappers on each render made the
 * spy, not the code under test, the thing that decided how often those memos were rebuilt, which
 * is a harness that changes the behaviour it is measuring. Keyed on the SDK's own functions, so
 * they stay stable exactly as long as the real ones do.

/**

 *
 * Parking a message takes its chips off the strip, and until this the number the client screened
 * against went with them: `stagedCount` resyncs from the strip, so after a park it read zero. The
 * server's cap counts something the park does not touch — every row this person has staged in this
 * composer's `uploadGroup` with `attachedAt IS NULL`, which a parked row is until the drained turn
 * is sent. So a ninth pick behind eight parked files was accepted here and refused there, which is
 * a per-draft cap and a per-group cap disagreeing by exactly the size of the queue.
 *
 * `composer.tsx` takes the number as `queuedAttachmentCount` and adds it to what it screens
 * against. It cannot work the number out itself — the queue is this file's, not the composer's —
 * so the composer's half is inert until something passes it, and this is the test that something
 * does. Without the prop on the `Composer` below, the ninth file uploads.

/**
 * THE ONE STATE IN WHICH A QUEUE IS NON-EMPTY AND NO TURN IS IN FLIGHT, which is worth a test of
 * its own because an argument made elsewhere leans on it.
 *
 * `composer-inflight-removal.test.tsx` pins that the composer PARKS rather than sends while a turn
 * is in flight, and concludes from it that `reduceQueue`'s submit-join — send now, with messages
 * already parked — is unreachable, which is what keeps the cap bumping the live draft's rows a
 * defensive path rather than a live one. That conclusion is right, and the reason given for it is
 * not the whole reason: it says the queue is only ever non-empty while a turn is in flight, and
 * here is the state where it is not. The drain refuses while the conversation is `disabled` — a
 * coworker deleted mid-turn — so the turn can end with the queue still full.
 *
 * What closes it is the OTHER guard, in `submitDraft`: a disabled composer returns before it can
 * either send or park. So there is still no way to reach the join, by a second route, and this is
 * the test that keeps the second route shut. If `disabled` ever stops gating the drain, the queue
 * empties into a channel this screen has already said is finished; if it ever stops gating
 * `submitDraft`, the join goes live.
