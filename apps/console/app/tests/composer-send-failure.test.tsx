/**
 * WHAT A FAILED SEND DOES TO THE WORDS, WHICH UNTIL NOW COULD NOT BE ASKED AT ALL.
 *
 * `submitDraft` used to rethrow out of its own catch, and it has exactly two callers:
 * `handleFormSubmit`, which does `void submitDraft(value)`, and PromptArea's `onSubmit`, which
 * calls it and ignores the promise. Neither awaits and neither catches, so a failed send was an
 * unhandled rejection — which bun's runner reports as a failure of whichever test is running when
 * it surfaces. `composer-attachment-lifecycle.test.tsx` and `composer-queue-attachments.test.tsx`
 * each carry a note recording that they gave up on driving a failed send for exactly that reason.
 * They are the reason this file exists: with the rethrow gone the path is reachable, and these are
 * the two things it has to get right.
 *
 * NO `fetch` STUB AND NO CHANNEL. Neither test attaches anything, so nothing here goes near the
 * network — the failure being driven is the caller's `onSubmit` rejecting, which is the whole of
 * what a failed turn looks like from inside the composer.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S. `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll` and `cleanup` in
 * `afterEach`, matching `composer-paste.test.tsx` for the reason recorded there: bun walks every
 * file into one process, and a document another file tore down mid-run fails invisibly.
