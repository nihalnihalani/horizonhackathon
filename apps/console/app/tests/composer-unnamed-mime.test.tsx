/**
 * A CLAIM THAT NAMES NO FORMAT, ALL THE WAY TO THE UPLOAD — WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE IT CAN BE SEEN.
 *
 * `screenPickedFiles` deliberately lets `application/octet-stream` and a blank type through so the
 * server can read the bytes (`picked-files.ts`, "THE BROWSER TOLD US NOTHING, SO THE SERVER GETS TO
 * LOOK"), and `picked-files.test.ts` pins that. It pins the pure function, and the pure function was
 * never the problem: the SDK's `processFiles` applies `AttachmentsConfig.accept` itself with an
 * exact `file.type === filter`, so for eighteen months the branch could be — and was — completely
 * dead downstream of a unit test that went on passing. Four reviewers found it by reading; nothing
 * in the suite could.
 *
 * So these tests are deliberately NOT about `screenPickedFiles`. They drive a real `Composer` with
 * the real `useAttachments`, and they assert on the two things only the whole path can show: that a
 * request went out, and that no refusal was drawn. That is the gap, and this is the level it lives
 * at.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S, matching `composer-upload-group.test.tsx` — `GlobalRegistrator`
 * in `beforeAll`/`afterAll` and `cleanup` in `afterEach`, because bun walks every file into one
 * process and a document another file tore down mid-run fails invisibly. The registration carries a
 * `url` because without one `location` is `about:blank` and the relative upload URL does not
 * resolve.
