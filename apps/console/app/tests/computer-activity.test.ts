/**
 * What a Bot did on its computer, other than browse.
 *
 * The screen said what it was looking at and nothing said what it was doing: a shell command was one
 * grey line with the output nowhere, so a person watching a Bot work on a machine holding their
 * logins had to take the model's word for what it printed.
 *
 * `outputOf` is the part that reads a result, and it is the part that gets it wrong: it looked for
 * `contents` on a file read, which is the name on the way in rather than the way back, and the pane
 * said "It printed nothing" about a file the Bot had just read out loud. These pin the field names.
