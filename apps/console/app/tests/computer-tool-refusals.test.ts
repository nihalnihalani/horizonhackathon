 * What a Bot is told when its action did not happen.
 *
 * Every refusal reaches the model as this object, and the fields decide what it does next: `staleRefs`
 * is the one its own tool description turns into "the page changed, call this again with the new
 * refs", so labelling a takeover with it sends the Bot back round the same action against the person
 * who just took the browser. The server carries `humanHasControl` for exactly that reason; this is
 * the end of that wire, and the only place the two conditions are told apart for the model.
