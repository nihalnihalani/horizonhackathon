/**
 * WHAT A FAILED SEND DOES TO THE FILES IT WAS CARRYING, DRIVEN THROUGH THE REAL CHANNEL.
 *
 * The composer suites reach this area through a fake `onSubmit` and `messages={[]}`, which is
 * exactly the state in which deleting a failed send's rows looks harmless: there is no transcript
 * to contradict, so a test can watch the DELETE go out and call it a release. The whole point of
 * this file is that the transcript IS there. `ChannelChat` is what turns a draft into a message —
 * it adds the user turn to `agent.messages` BEFORE the run, so by the time the run fails the
 * screen is already showing a message whose attachments point at those rows — and only a test
 * that goes through it can see the two halves at once.
 *
 * So everything below the HTTP boundary is real: the provider, the agent, `say`/`deliver`, the
 * conversation view's queue, and the composer. Only `fetch` is a fixture, and it is the fixture
 * that decides the two failures under test — a run that answers 503, and an upload that answers
 * with a stored row id.
 *
 * TEXT FILES RATHER THAN THE REVIEWER'S SCREENSHOT, and nothing in the path cares: a staged row is
 * a staged row, `attachmentUrl` addresses both the same way, and the release, the cap and the
 * queue all count them identically. An image tile would additionally ask happy-dom to load an
 * `<img>`, which is a second fixture for a detail this file is not about.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S. `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll`, `cleanup` in
 * `afterEach`, and `settleReactWork()` before the document goes away — see that helper for what a
 * scheduler callback landing after `unregister()` does to an otherwise green run.
