/**
 * What a person's click turns into while they hold the wheel.
 *
 * The canvas sends nothing until it knows how large the frames are, because a click has to be mapped
 * from where it landed on screen to where it landed on the page. So each test feeds one frame first.
 * The bitmap decode inside that handler is allowed to fail here — there is no `createImageBitmap`
 * under happy-dom, and the component already treats a frame it cannot draw as one to skip — but the
 * size is recorded before the decode is attempted, which is the part these need.
