 * Granting a batch of tools, and what a batch is allowed to cost.
 *
 * The admin dialog grants a tool per Bot per tick, so choosing two Bots and twelve tools is
 * twenty-four writes. Every one of them used to go through the grant mutation, which invalidates
 * every plugin query and waits for the refetch — so most of the wait was re-reading a list hidden
 * behind the dialog. `grantPlugin` is the write on its own, and the caller refetches once at the
 * end. These pin that the write is unchanged and that the refetch is not attached to it.
