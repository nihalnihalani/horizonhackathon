/**
 * The one coupling in this feature that can break silently.
 *
 * The app offers the four authoring tools only to a Bot holding `SKILL_CREATOR_SLUG`, and the shipped
 * package is what puts a skill under that slug in the deployment and grants it to a Bot. Neither half
 * fails loudly without the other: rename the slug in the YAML and the tools are simply never offered,
 * grant it to nobody and there is no Bot to write a skill with. Both look like a working deployment
 * where writing a skill in a conversation does nothing, which is the kind of break nobody finds.
 *
 * Read from the file rather than from a fixture, because the file is what ships.
