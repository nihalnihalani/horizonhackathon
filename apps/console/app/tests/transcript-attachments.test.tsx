/**
 * `toVisibleChatItems` (chat-messages.ts) gathers the attachment parts of a user turn into one
 * `{ kind: "attachments" }` item; this pins what the transcript draws for it, which until this
 * feature was an explicit `null` — a screenshot pasted with no caption rendered as nothing at all.
 *
 * It also pins the two ways an attachment-only turn has to behave like a typed one — the Thinking
 * indicator and the scroll anchor — and, in the same breath, that a CAPTIONED turn still anchors
 * exactly once. The scroller jumps to the end when it finds two anchors among the rows appended
 * together, so the naive "every attachment is an anchor" rule fixes the first case by breaking the
 * ordinary one, and only a test that counts anchors notices.
 *
 * URLS ARE RELATIVE HERE BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY KIND A SENT MESSAGE CARRIES. `shared/attachments.ts`
 * says so, and the transcript now refuses anything else rather than fetching it.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S. `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll` and `cleanup` in
 * `afterEach`, matching `agent-roster-error.test.tsx`: bun walks every file into one process, and a
 * document another file tore down mid-run fails invisibly.
 *
 * WITH ONE ADDITION: an origin. happy-dom defaults to `about:blank`, against which a relative `src`
 * does not resolve at all, and the image element fires `error` before anything has been asserted —
 * so every attachment would test as unavailable and the tests below would agree with a transcript
 * that draws nothing.

 * a document therefore makes a request, and left unstubbed each one would be a real socket to a
 * server that is not running — slow, and answering "gone" for the wrong reason. The default answer

 * is exactly why it is pinned here instead of trusted to the comment beside it.
 *
 * The scroller identifies a newly appended row POSITIONALLY. On each content change it takes
 * `Array.from(content.children)` minus the spacer, compares the length with the previous length,
 * and on growth scans from the OLD LENGTH FORWARD for the next `data-scroll-anchor="true"`. That
 * only finds the row if the row is last. With the parked block moved below `items.map`, every
 * appended row lands one slot short of the end, the scan meets the block instead, finds no anchor
 * and gives up — and a new turn stops aligning to the top of the viewport. No existing test sees
 * it, because the anchor ATTRIBUTE is still on the right row; it is the row's INDEX that broke.
 *
 * So this asserts the ordering the scroller needs, in the terms the scroller reads it in: among the
 * children of the content element, the block sits ahead of every transcript row.
 *
 * IT PINS A COST TOO, AND KNOWINGLY. Focus order and the reading order of the enclosing
 * `role="log"` follow the DOM, not `order`, so a keyboard user meets the queue's Remove buttons
 * before the conversation and a screen reader hears parked messages ahead of it. That debt is
 * described in full at the block itself. This test does not bless it — it records that the naive
 * repair is not available, so that whoever pays it properly changes the scroller's row detection
 * rather than only this markup, and has a failing test to tell them which one they changed.
