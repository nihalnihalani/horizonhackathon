The same name, under the shorter limit Kubernetes puts on a CronJob.

FIFTY-TWO, NOT SIXTY-THREE. A CronJob is the one workload whose name is not the whole budget: the
controller names each Job it creates `<cronjob>-<unix-minute>`, so the API server refuses a CronJob
whose own name leaves no room for that suffix — "must be no more than 52 characters". Sixty-three is
the right limit for every other object this chart writes and the wrong one here, and the failure is
not a truncated name, it is `helm install` rejected outright.

Reached at a 43-character release name, which is an ordinary length for a name that says the
environment and the region. All three of this chart's CronJobs were built on the 63-character helper
and all three were rejected together.

THE RELEASE NAME IS TRUNCATED, NOT THE WHOLE STRING, so the component survives. Cutting the joined
name at 52 would give a long release two CronJobs called the same thing — `...-routines` and
`...-culler` both ending as the first 52 characters of the release name — which is a release that
cannot install for a second, stranger reason. Trimming the prefix instead keeps the suffix that says

{{/*
Whether the staged-attachment sweep runs.

ONE ANSWER FOR TWO TEMPLATES, because the CronJob and the NetworkPolicy that fences it must agree:
a sweep with no policy is the one pod left unfenced on a cluster that enforces them, and a policy
with no sweep is a resource selecting nothing. They were two copies of the same expression, which is
the shape that drifts.

GUARDED AT BOTH LEVELS, AND DEFAULTED TO ON. `attachments` is a key this chart did not have before,
and `helm upgrade --reuse-values` takes the previous release's computed values rather than merging
the new chart's defaults, so on every existing deployment the whole map is absent — and on a release
installed between the two, `culler` is present without `enabled`. `(.Values.attachments).culler.enabled`
parenthesises one level of that and reads the next two bare: with `enabled` missing the sweep and its
policy silently did not render at all, and with `culler` missing the render died on a nil pointer,
which fails the install rather than the feature.

`kindIs "invalid"` rather than `| default true`, for the reason `commonEnv` gives above: sprig's
`default` substitutes on EMPTY, and `false` is empty, so `| default true` would switch the sweep back
on for the deployment that had deliberately switched it off.

IT ANSWERS THE SAME QUESTION ITS SIBLINGS DO, WHICH IT USED NOT TO. This used to hand the value back
untouched for its callers to compare against the string `"true"`, and a string comparison is not what
`if .Values.routines.enabled` next door does. `--set attachments.culler.enabled=1` reaches a template
as the integer 1, and `=yes` reaches it as the string "yes". Go's templating calls both of those
true, so the routines CronJob renders for either — while this returned "1" or "yes", matched neither
caller, and rendered NEITHER the CronJob NOR the NetworkPolicy that fences it. No error, no resource,
and an operator with every reason to believe the sweep was on. Both spellings were driven through
`helm template` before this changed and after. The answer is now the template engine's own notion of
truth, which is the one the rest of the chart was already using.

THE ONE VALUE IT REFUSES RATHER THAN HONOURS, because agreeing with the siblings here would have been
a regression rather than a fix. That same notion of truth calls the non-empty string "false" TRUE, so
`--set-string attachments.culler.enabled=false` would start the sweep for somebody who had just
written the word false. The old string comparison happened to get that one case right, and a fix is
not allowed to take a correct behaviour away. There is no reading of `--set-string ...=false` that
means ON and no safe way to guess, so it fails the render with a message naming `--set` instead. That
is a narrower rule than it looks: only a STRING spelling a falsehood ever reaches it, and `--set`,
which parses `false` into a boolean, cannot produce one.

{{/*
The service range the Kubernetes API server answers on, or a refusal to render a policy without it.

ONE ANSWER FOR TWO TEMPLATES, for the same reason as the sweep gate above: the API server's policy
and the computer culler's both need this rule, and both had it wrong in exactly the same way.

WHY THIS REFUSES INSTEAD OF DEFAULTING. Both policies used to write the rule as
`- {{ with .Values.networkPolicy.kubernetesApiCidr }}to: ...{{ end }}` and let the empty default fall
straight through the `with`. What fell out was an egress rule carrying ports and NO PEER AT ALL, and
in Kubernetes that is neither a narrow rule nor an inert one: an empty or absent `to` matches every
destination. So the shipped default granted 443 and 6443 to everything, which cancelled the `10/8`,
`172.16/12`, `192.168/16` and `169.254/16` exceptions the rule one line above it spells out. On the
culler, whose only other egress is DNS and the database, that peerless rule WAS its entire reach: a
pod holding the database credential could open an HTTPS socket to any address in the cluster or on
the internet. Rendered and read back before any of this was believed.

THE TWO ALTERNATIVES, AND WHY NEITHER. Rendering no rule at all when nobody has named a CIDR is safe
and silent, and silent is the whole problem: on a cluster that enforces policy the API server can no
longer ask for a Bot's computer, so every browser action fails and the deployment looks broken rather
than fenced — which is the exact failure the comment two rules above this one warns about. Picking a
default CIDR is worse: the range belongs to the cluster and not to the release, so `172.20.0.0/16` is
right on EKS and an outage on GKE, and a wrong CIDR is that outage with a plausible-looking values
file standing behind it. Refusing is the only one of the three that cannot be wrong quietly, and it
is what this chart does everywhere else a value is unknowable and load-bearing. `helm upgrade`
renders before it applies anything, so a release that hits this keeps running exactly as it was while
its operator runs the single command in the message.

SCOPED TO THE POLICIES THAT NEED IT. Reached only from inside `networkPolicy.enabled` and
`computers.mode: sandbox`, so a deployment with no policies, or with `mode: shared`, never has to
name it. Nothing else in the chart consults it.

Whether the API pod gets a Kubernetes token.

FALSE UNLESS IT ACTUALLY NEEDS ONE. The API talks to a database and to Bots, not to the cluster, so a
mounted token is a credential sitting in a pod that has no use for it. `computers.mode: sandbox` is
the exception and the only one: there the server asks the API server to create, resume and suspend a
Sandbox per Bot, and without a token it fails on the first browser action with a missing file rather
than anything that names the cause.
