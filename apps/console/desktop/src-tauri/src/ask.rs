/*!
The last screen: a real question, put to the Bot that was just set up.

WHY THE INSTALL DOES NOT END AT "SAVED". Everything before this proves that things started, which
is not the same as proving the configuration works. A wrong key, an expired plan, a model name the
provider does not serve: all of them produce a stack that comes up clean and a Bot that cannot
answer, and the person finds out later, in the product, with no idea which of the choices they made
was the wrong one. So the wizard ends by asking a question and showing the answer. A configuration
that has not answered is not a finished install.

AND THIS SCREEN OWNS THE WORST MESSAGE IN THE PRODUCT. Measured on a deliberately invalid key: the
stream opens, says `RUN_STARTED`, says `STEP_STARTED`, and then simply stops. No error event, no
reason, nothing to show. The whole of `OpenAIAuthenticationError: Error code: 401` went to the
container's log, which is where the framework's own handler put it. Passing that experience through
would leave somebody staring at a screen that stopped, so a run that produces no text is treated as
a failure here, the sentence is OpenBot's own, and the container's log is fetched to fill the
developer half, because otherwise there is no developer half at all.
