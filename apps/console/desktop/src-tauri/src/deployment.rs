//! Putting the deployment on disk, which is not what the installer carries.
//!
//! The installer stays small: a Tauri binary and nothing else. What it needs to run a deployment —
//! `docker-compose.yml`, `server`, `app`, `worker`, the tenant package — is fetched on first run and
//! kept beside it, at a version this app records. Two things follow from that split, and both are
//! the reason for it: the download stays a download rather than becoming part of every installer,
//! and the deployment can be moved forward on its own without shipping a new app.
//!
//! What is fetched is the release's own source tarball, at a tag. Not `main`: an app that pulls
//! whatever is on a branch this morning is not a version anybody can be given, and the images the
//! stack runs are pinned per release, so the tree that names them has to be pinned too.
