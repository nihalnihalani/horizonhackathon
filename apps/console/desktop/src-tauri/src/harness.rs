//! The harness picker's list, as data.
//!
//! One list, and every row resolves to the same thing: an AG-UI URL registered as a Bot. A row is
//! a manifest rather than a branch in wizard code, so adding a harness is an entry here plus an
//! image, and never a new screen.
//!
//! Two things this list deliberately does not contain. OpenBot's own `built-in` agent type, which
//! is a system prompt and not a harness: everybody leaves setup with a real one, either an image we
//! publish or an address they already run. And anything whose AG-UI integration we would have to
//! write ourselves. A harness earns a row only when the integration exists and somebody other than
//! us keeps it working, which is why Codex and Gemini CLI are absent despite being the two most
//! popular harnesses there are.
//!
//! Rows and maintainer classes come from the AG-UI repository's own support table, which is
//! canonical. `docs.ag-ui.com` disagrees on several and is wrong.

Which Bot can use a signed-in subscription, by vendor.

THE CONSTRAINT IS ON THE LOGIN, NOT THE FRAMEWORK, and this is where that bites. Every harness on
the list takes any model through an API key, so the Bot step and the model step are independent
there. A subscription is different: it only ever buys that vendor's own models, and only through a
path that speaks that vendor's subscription auth. Anthropic's is the Claude Agent SDK, which reads
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`; OpenAI's is the Codex model, which the LangGraph AG-UI image selects from
the token store.

MEASURED, on the screen built to catch it: signing in to a Claude plan and keeping the default Bot
produced a stack that came up clean and a Bot whose own log said "Missing credentials. Please pass
an `api_key`". The last screen showed the failure, which is what it is for, but the person had done
nothing wrong and had no way to know which of two correct-looking answers to change.

Nobody is asked to know this. The plan picks the Bot that can use it.
