//! Signing in to CopilotKit Intelligence, so nobody is sent to a terminal for a key.
//!
//! THE LAST DEVELOPER-SHAPED ASK IN SETUP. Before this, the final screen wanted an "Intelligence
//! project key", and the only way to produce one was `npx copilotkit login` followed by
//! `copilotkit project select`. That is two commands, a terminal and a package manager, for
//! somebody whose entire relationship with this product is a window their IT department sent them.
//! The audience rule says any step that amounts to "go and get something and come back" is a
//! defect, and that was the largest one left.
//!
//! The flow is the CLI's own, done here instead: a loopback callback, an exchange, and a key this
//! deployment provisions for the project the person chose. Reading it out of the CLI rather than
//! inventing it is deliberate — the endpoints, the parameter names and the order all belong to
//! whoever changes them, and guessing at somebody else's auth is how this breaks silently later.
