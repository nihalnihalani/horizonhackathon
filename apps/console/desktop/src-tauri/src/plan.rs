//! Signing in to a Claude plan, so nobody has to hold an API key.
//!
//! This is the default path on the model screen: anybody with a key and a base URL to hand is a
//! developer, and everybody else has a plan they already pay for.
//!
//! ANTHROPIC'S OWN CLI DOES THE FLOW. It starts the OAuth, shows the consent URL, takes the code
//! back and exchanges it. Reimplementing that here would mean holding somebody else's OAuth client
//! id, redirect and PKCE details and re-shipping them whenever any of it moves. Driving the
//! vendor's command is the same call as reaching Mastra through Mastra's own bridge.
//!
//! AND NOTHING HAS TO BE INSTALLED FOR IT. The Claude Agent SDK ships a self-contained `claude`
//! binary inside the Python package, so the harness image OpenBot already pulls has a working CLI
//! at `_bundled/claude` and the person's machine needs no Node, no npm and no CLI of their own.
//!
//! The flow runs in that container, which is why the code is pasted rather than redirected. The
//! CLI's local callback server is unreachable from a browser outside the container, so it falls
//! back to `code=true` and prints a code for the person to bring back. Anthropic documents that
//! fallback for exactly this case: "common in WSL2, SSH sessions, and containers".

/**
The ChatGPT sign-in, as a program handed to the harness image.

WHY THERE IS A RELAY IN HERE. `langchain-openai` refuses a non-loopback callback host on purpose:
RFC 8252 wants a loopback redirect for a native app, and binding `0.0.0.0` would put the
authorization code on the local network. But a published Docker port cannot reach a `127.0.0.1`
listener inside the container. So the vendor's server keeps its loopback bind and this relay accepts
on `0.0.0.0:1456` and forwards into it. The container publishes 1456 as the host's 1455, which is
the address the browser is sent to.

AND THE HOST IS LEFT AT ITS DEFAULT, `localhost`, WHICH IS NOT COSMETIC. OpenAI compares the
redirect URI as a string, and `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback` is what is registered. Passing
`127.0.0.1` — the same address, a different string — makes the authorize request fail with
`unknown_error` before any login page is drawn. Measured, twice, before the cause was obvious.

AND WHAT IS PRINTED IS THE WHOLE STORE, NOT THE ACCESS TOKEN. The access token expires within the
hour and nothing can renew it; the store carries the refresh token beside it, which is what the
harness's provider renews from. Carrying only the token yields a Bot that answers until lunchtime
and then reports an auth failure nobody can account for.

Passed as an argument rather than a mounted file, so the app never has to write a script to disk to
run one.
