//! What a person is told when something fails, and what a developer is told at the same time.
//!
//! TWO PARTS, ALWAYS, and this exists because one part is never enough for both readers. The
//! person needs a sentence about their situation and what to do next; whoever is debugging needs
//! the actual output, verbatim, including the bits that are only meaningful to them. Collapse them
//! and one of the two is failed: a plain sentence alone throws away the evidence, and raw engine
//! output alone is what put "pull access denied for openbot-agent-langgraph-agui, repository does
//! not exist or may require 'docker login'" in front of somebody who was setting up an app.
//!
//! The window shows `said` as the failure and keeps `detail` behind a disclosure, so the default
//! reading is the human one and nothing is lost.
