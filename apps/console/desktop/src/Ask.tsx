 * is not the same as proving the choices work: a refused key, a lapsed plan or a model the account
 * cannot use all produce a stack that comes up clean and a Bot that cannot answer. Somebody would
 * find that out later, inside the product, with no idea which answer was the wrong one. So the
 * wizard ends by asking, and the answer on this screen is the proof.
 *
 * One suggested question, already filled in, with one right answer. "Tell me about yourself" is
 * answered convincingly by a Bot whose model credential is fine and whose everything else is
 * broken, and this screen exists to prove rather than to reassure.
