 * between them is nil: they all take any model and they all answer the same questions. Asking a
 * non-technical person to pick one is asking them to make a decision they cannot inform, at the
 * start, which is where people leave.
 *
 * So the default is stated in one line and the list moves behind a disclosure. A developer who
 * wants CrewAI opens it and picks CrewAI; everybody else presses Continue and never learns the word
 * "harness". The address-your-own row lives in there too, because pasting a URL is the most
 * developer thing on this screen.
