/**
 * One sweep: notice which computers have gone idle, and suspend whatever this pod can claim.
 *
 * Run from a CronJob rather than from a timer inside the API. Every replica would fire its own timer
 * and each would decide, independently, to suspend the same computer. Deleting old audit rows twice
 * is harmless, which is why the retention sweep may work that way; taking a browser away from
 * somebody who has just come back is not.
 *
 * Exits non-zero only when the sweep itself could not run. A computer that refused to suspend is
 * reported and left for the next sweep, because a computer still running costs money rather than
 * losing anything, and a failing CronJob that pages somebody at 3am should mean something worse.
