/**
 * One sweep: notice which routines are due, and fire whatever this pod can claim.
 *
 * Run from a CronJob rather than from a timer inside the API, for the reason the culler states: every
 * replica would fire its own timer and each would independently decide that the 09:00 summary is due.
 * Deleting old audit rows twice is harmless, which is why the retention sweep may work that way;
 * posting somebody's morning summary three times is not, and neither is spending three turns' worth
 * of tokens on it.
 *
 * Exits non-zero only when a phase itself could not run — no database, no secret, no server to hand a
 * run to. A single firing that failed is reported and left on the queue for the next sweep, because a
 * routine that fires a minute late has lost nothing, and a failing CronJob that pages somebody at 3am
 * should mean something worse than that.
