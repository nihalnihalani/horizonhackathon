 * next to the endpoint would make it readable by anything that can read an agent, including the
 * admin API that lists them, and there would be no way to revoke it without editing the agent.
 *
 * The vault holds the value. The agent's configuration holds only the
 * credential's id and the header name, because the name is not a secret and the surface needs to
 * show "sends an Authorization header" without being able to show what it sends.
 *
 * It is never read back to a person. There is no endpoint that returns it and no field that
 * repopulates with it: the edit form shows that a key is set, and setting a new one replaces it. A
 * secret a UI can display is a secret in a screenshot.

 * at it, leaving the previous one decryptable and still valid with nothing listing it and no way to
 * reach it: the honest answer to "is that leaked key still live" was yes. The vault also grew one
 * unrevoked secret per edit per Bot.
 *
 * Takes both configurations rather than a credential id, so the caller cannot get the direction
 * wrong and revoke the key it has just stored. Does nothing when the id has not changed, which is an
 * edit that left the key alone.
 *
 * Never throws. The new key is already stored and the Bot already works; a vault that would not
 * accept the revocation is worth saying loudly and is not worth failing an edit that has succeeded.
 *
 * Takes the caller's transaction where there is one, and must be given it whenever the caller holds
 * a lock on the row being retired. On a pooled connection the revoke is a second session competing
 * with the caller's own open transaction: it waits for a lock only that transaction can release, and
 * the transaction cannot commit while it is awaiting this call. Nothing breaks that, so the edit
 * hangs to the statement timeout and the timeout is then reported here as a key still live.
