 * therefore held the form open for as long as its run took, and if that outlasted the timeout the
 * abort came back through `text()` as a rejected read: `ok: false`, status 200, "The agent started
 * answering and the connection broke." Nothing broke. The agent had answered correctly, in the first
 * two events, and the person registering it was told to go and look at their own service.
 *
 * Counted in bytes, which is what the cap is named in and what a chunk off the wire is measured in.
 * The chunk that crosses the cap is kept whole rather than cut at it: it is one read past the cap at
 * most, and a cut through a multi-byte character would put a replacement character in the middle of
 * a line the scan is about to read.
