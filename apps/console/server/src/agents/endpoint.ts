/**
 * Where an external agent lives, and whether we are willing to talk to it.
 *
 * Registering an agent hands us a URL that this server will POST to on every single run. That is a
 * server-side request to an address a user chose,
 * which is the textbook shape of SSRF: without a check, `http://169.254.169.254/` is a registrable
 * "agent" and the runtime will happily fetch cloud credentials on a user's behalf, from inside the
 * deployment, on a schedule.
 *
 * Ordering is the control. If the private-host escape hatch is consulted before the
 * deny-list, the cloud metadata endpoint is reachable under the configuration every developer
 * actually runs. Never-allowed hosts are refused first, ahead of any opt-in, which is why this reuses
 * `checkNavigationTarget` rather than a second checker that would have to get the ordering right
 * again.
 *
 * A developer's own agent legitimately lives at
 * `http://localhost:4200/ag-ui`, so on a laptop the private-host opt-in is ON, which is the case where
 * this check is weakest. That is the same trade navigation makes, and the reason the never-allowed
 * list is checked ahead of it. In a hosted deployment the opt-in is off and a private address is
 * refused.

 * Is this address one the deployment named, and refused only for being private?

 * the metadata address or is not a web address at all", which nothing may. Deciding that by reading
 * the refusal text would break the first time somebody rephrased it.
 *
 * Matching is exact, on the host as written, and a name with a port pins that port. No suffixes and
 * no patterns: a pattern that widened by accident is how host checks usually fail, and an operator

 * in it: `https://agent.example.com/ag-ui` passes, answers `307`, and the request lands wherever the
 * `Location` header says, which is how a registrable agent becomes a way to read the deployment's own
 * cloud metadata. The address that gets dialled is the one that must be allowed, and a redirect makes
 * those two different addresses.
 *
 * The stored address is checked too, not only the hops after it. A row written before this guard
 * existed, or under a rule that has since changed, is dialled on every run, and that is the one
 * address a check that only reads `Location` headers never looks at.
 *
 * Redirects are followed rather than refused, because a deployment that puts its agent behind one has
 * done nothing wrong and `http` to `https` is the common case. Each destination goes through
 * {@link checkAgentEndpoint} first, so following one can only ever reach somewhere registering it
 * directly would have been allowed to reach.
 *
 * A hop that leaves the host the request was authorised for arrives with nothing that proves who we
 * are: the customer's key is theirs and was given to us for their host, and the run assertion is
 * this deployment's own capability. Once dropped they stay dropped, so a chain that wanders off and
 * comes back does not collect them again.
 *
 * The method and body are carried across every hop. A browser turns a redirected `POST` into a `GET`;
 * doing that here would only ever produce a confusing "that is not an AG-UI endpoint" from an agent
 * that is one, because AG-UI is a POST protocol and this is a server talking to an API, not a person
