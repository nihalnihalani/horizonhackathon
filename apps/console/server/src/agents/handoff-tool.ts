/**
 * The tool one Bot uses to hand work to another.
 *
 * Offered beside a Bot's granted tools rather than through a new transport, so which Bots may reach
 * which other Bots is an ordinary grant an administrator makes. A Bot with no such grant is offered
 * nothing and cannot address anybody, which is the correct default.
 *
 * WHAT IT TAKES IS TYPED, and that is the one place this departs from the obvious build. The natural
 * shape is `message_bot(target, message)` and free text is the commonest way a multi-agent system
 * goes quietly wrong: the receiving Bot infers the intent, re-derives the constraints and guesses
 * what shape of answer was wanted, and when it guesses wrong it does not fail, it returns something
 * else confidently. Naming the parts costs the asking model a little effort and removes most of that.
