 * that fails is not a refusal anybody can read, it is the pod's heap, which
 * takes every other person's in-flight run down with it.
 *
 * 32 MiB of stored bytes is about 43 MB once base64'd. Four files at the
 * `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` ceiling, or thirty-two at the `MAX_FILE_BYTES` one: well
 * past what a conversation refers back to, and far short of what exhausts a
 * process.
 *
 * SPENT NEWEST-FIRST, WHICH IS WHY THE ASKED MESSAGE IS SERVED WHOLE.
 * `inlineAttachments` walks the history backwards, so the message being asked
 * about is charged first and is never the one cut; what runs out is the room
 * left for the messages behind it, which the model has already been shown once
 * in the turn they arrived.
 *
 * AND IT BOUNDS THAT MESSAGE TOO, BY REFUSING IT RATHER THAN CUTTING IT.
 * Charged first is not the same as bounded, though for a while this comment was
 * read that way: both places that stopped spending tested for
 * `onMissing === "note"`, so this number bounded only the half of a run that
 * could degrade, and a message a browser wrote naming two hundred
 * previously-sent 8 MiB files inlined every one of them. A message past this
 * limit now fails its turn with a sentence a person can act on — see
 * {@link tooMuchToInline} — which keeps what the strict mode is for, that the
 * asked message arrives in full or not at all, while giving "in full" a
 * ceiling.
 *
 * WHAT IT COUNTS IS PARTS EMITTED, NOT DISTINCT FILES READ — AND THE DIFFERENCE
 * IS NOT A ROUNDING ERROR. For a while the charge was deduplicated by id: a
 * `charged` set meant the second and every later part naming one id was both
 * free and exempt from the cut, on the reasoning that one id is fetched once so
 * it should be billed once. The premise is true and the conclusion does not
 * follow. `resolveAttachmentParts` emits a base64 part for EVERY OCCURRENCE of
 * an id — it must, because two parts cannot share one object — so what a run
 * holds live is one encoded copy per PART, and a bound that counts distinct ids
 * is not measuring the quantity it exists to bound.
 *
 * The measured failure: forty parts naming one stored 1,024-byte image, against
 * a budget of 1,024, produced one read, forty inlined parts, 40,960 decoded
 * bytes — and `remaining` sitting at zero, reporting a budget spent exactly to
 * its limit. At the 8 MiB upload ceiling a hundred references to one file come
 * to roughly 1.04 GiB of base64 against a 32 MiB budget. A repeated id was not
 * an exotic input either: it is what quoting the same chart twice in a message
 * looks like, and it cost nothing to write.
 *
 * SO THE CHARGE RUNS PER PART AND THE MEMO STAYS. `loadOnce` still fetches one
 * id once — deduplicating the READ was never the bug and saves a real database
 * round trip — but every part that gets encoded draws the budget down by the
 * stored bytes it is about to encode, and once the room is gone no id is
 * exempt from being cut. Charging per part is the honest number: those bytes
 * really are base64-ed into the run that many times.
 *
 * DEDUPLICATING THE OUTPUT INSTEAD WAS THE OTHER WAY TO MAKE THE TWO NUMBERS
 * AGREE, AND IS REJECTED. Emitting one part per distinct id would make "one
 * charge per id" true by making one copy the only copy, but it changes what the
 * model is handed — a message that names a file at two points in its content
 * means to refer to it at both — and it breaks the rule that whatever runs after
 * this owns the parts it was given, which `attachment-parts.test.ts` pins with
 * `expect(result[0]).not.toBe(result[1])`. Bounding the output is this budget's
 * job; rewriting the message is not.
 *
 * It lives HERE and not in `shared/attachments.ts` beside the other limits on
 * purpose. Those are limits two sides have to agree on — the composer refuses
 * a file and the server refuses it again — and that file's whole argument is
 * the drift between the two. This one is neither: the composer has no say in
 * how much of a thread a turn replays, and nothing in a browser can observe
 * it.

 * attachment, so that early return is load-bearing, not an optimization:
 * callers that compare the result to the input (e.g. to decide whether a
 * cache entry changed) depend on getting the same reference back.
 *
 * `onMissing` DEFAULTS TO "fail", so a caller that has not thought about
 * which message this is gets the strict answer. It is the message being
 * asked about that must fail: an unloadable attachment there is one the
 * answer was supposed to be about.
 *
 * For an older message it must not. History is replayed in full on every
 * turn, so a row that vanished once would fail this channel's every future
 * turn, for ever, with no recovery but starting another channel — the same
 * shape as the dangling tool call in `agents/history-sanitize.ts`, found in
 * production twice: a permanent failure grown out of transient damage, and
 * nothing the person did wrong. That file's answer is this one's. History is
 * CONTEXT for a turn, not a transaction to resume; the attachment is already
 * permanently gone and there is nothing to fetch; so the choice is between a
 * conversation that can never run again and the same conversation with one
 * old file marked missing.
 *
 * `budget`, when given, is how much this RUN may still inline; see
 * {@link MAX_INLINED_BYTES_PER_RUN}. Absent means unbounded, which is what
 * this did before the budget existed and what a single-message caller wants.
 *
 * IT BOUNDS THIS MESSAGE WHICHEVER `onMissing` SAYS — what changes is the answer when it runs out.
 * Under `"note"` the parts that did not fit become text saying so and the call returns; under
 * `"fail"` the call REJECTS, because that mode is the message being asked about and a person's own
 * question is not something to quietly serve half of. A caller passing `"fail"` with a budget is
 * therefore asking for "all of it or an error", which is what {@link tooMuchToInline} spells out.
 *
 * PARTS RESOLVE ONE AT A TIME, not through `Promise.all`. Two reasons, and the
 * first is correctness: a budget spent by whichever load happened to settle
 * first would cut a different part on each run over the same thread. The
 * second is the peak — `Promise.all` over eight parts holds eight files and
 * their base64 at once, which is the shape that exhausts a heap. What is given
 * up is concurrency across a handful of small reads, on the rare message that
 * carries a file at all.
 *
 * ONE READ PER DISTINCT ID, ONE CHARGE PER PART. The same id on two parts of one
 * message is loaded once — `loadOnce` below — and encoded twice, because two
 * parts must not share one object: whatever runs after this is entitled to treat
 * the parts it was handed as its own. Those two copies are two charges against
 * the budget, because they are two base64 strings live at once.
 *
 * THE TWO HALVES OF THAT SENTENCE MUST NOT BE COLLAPSED INTO ONE. This once read
 * "one read per distinct id, and one charge", with a `charged` set making the
 * second half true, and the result was a budget that bounded nothing a repeated
 * id could do to it: forty parts naming one 1 KiB file inlined 40 KiB under a
 * 1 KiB budget. Deduplicating the read is a saving; deduplicating the charge is a
 * hole. See {@link MAX_INLINED_BYTES_PER_RUN} for the full arithmetic, and
 * `attachment-parts.test.ts`, which asserts the memo and the per-part charge as
 * separate claims and measures the bound on DECODED OUTPUT BYTES rather than on
 * `budget.remaining` — the counter read zero while forty copies went out.
 *
 * THE MEMO IS WITHIN ONE MESSAGE, WHICH IS ONE CALL OF THIS FUNCTION, AND NOT
 * ACROSS THE RUN. It is built here, so it does not outlive the message, and an id
 * quoted in two messages of one thread is read twice. That is the intended scope:
 * a run-scoped memo would pin every distinct attachment's `Buffer` live for the
 * whole backward walk, and what is live at the peak is the thing this budget
 * exists to bound. Trading a rare second read for unbounded buffer retention is
 * the wrong way round.
