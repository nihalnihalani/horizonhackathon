 * statements where one will do, so under READ COMMITTED the mapping can change between them; and,
 * far more importantly, it makes the scope a thing a caller REMEMBERS — a second `string` argument
 * beside `actorId`, which the next person to add a call site can pass the wrong value for, or the
 * right value from the wrong run, and get no complaint from anything. As a correlated subquery the
 * scope is part of the statement that reads the row: there is no way to ask for an attachment
 * without asking this at the same time, because it is the same query.
 *
 * The two callers take `threadId` in a NAMED FIELD for the same reason. `actorId` and `threadId`
 * are both `string`, adjacent, and positionally swappable with no type error and no test failure —
 * the swap would simply widen the scope back to what it was. An object parameter cannot be
 * transposed.
 *
 * AND IT DEGRADES WHEN THE THREAD MAPS TO NO CHANNEL, which is the half that took evidence to get
 * right rather than reasoning. The tempting shape is an INNER JOIN on
 * `intelligence_channel_mappings`: no mapping, no attachment. That is wrong, because three real
 * surfaces run turns on threads this deployment deliberately keeps no channel for:
 *
 *  - A FORWARD AGENT HOP. `handoff-delivery.ts` mints a scratch thread of the addressed Bot's own
 *    (an Intelligence thread has exactly one agent, so a second Bot cannot answer inside the
 *    first's conversation) and then seeds it with the ASKING channel's history, attachment parts
 *    and all. Under an inner join every one of those files would resolve to null on a thread that
 *    maps to nothing, and because history is resolved with `onMissing: "note"` the addressed Bot
 *    would be told `[attachment "x" is no longer available]` about files that exist and that the
 *    same person may read. It would not even fail loudly: a hop's last user message is the
 *    synthetic instruction `handoff-delivery.ts` appends, so the `"fail"` branch that exists to
 *    catch exactly this never covers a hop's history.
 *  - THE DIRECT `/bot` CHAT, whose thread comes from `POST /api/threads/mint` — "a conversation
 *    this deployment keeps no channel for", in that route's own words. Its runs go through the
 *    ordinary runtime endpoint and so reach this loader.
 *  - A BACKWARDS HOP relaying into either of those.
 *
 * So the rule is: if this thread belongs to a channel, the file must belong to that same channel;
 * if it belongs to no channel, this adds nothing and the membership join above remains the whole of
 * the check. That is strictly narrower than what was here before and never narrower than a working
 * surface needs, which is the only combination that closes the gap without breaking a hop.
 *
 * NOTE WHAT IT STILL STOPS, because the degrade reads more permissive than it is. The case the
 * reviewers reproduced is a person in channels A and B naming an A-file on a turn in B. B's thread
 * IS mapped, so the degrade branch does not apply, the subquery yields B, and A ≠ B refuses. The
 * branch only opens for a thread nobody is shown.

/**
 * The file behind an attachment reference, read for one person's turn. A PURE READ: nothing about
 * being shown a file says anybody sent it, and this function writes nothing.
 *
 * PER ACTOR, AND THE JOIN IS THE CHECK — the live channel and the actor's membership on it, which
 * is the join the upload route leads with and the one `GET /api/attachments/:id` below uses. The id
 * this is called with came out of `input.messages`, which is the browser's: `resolveAttachmentParts`
 * (attachment-parts.ts) reads it out of a user message's own content, and nothing between the wire
 * and here rejects a message that was never in the thread — the runtime hands the input to the agent
 * and only filters what it PERSISTS. So a signed-in person can put an `/api/attachments/<id>` part
 * for a channel they are not in on a message they compose themselves, and no uuid needs guessing to
 * do it: somebody removed from a channel still holds its ids in their local transcript. This function
 * therefore cannot assume the asker is entitled to what they named, and checks membership itself
 * rather than inferring it from where the id came from.
 *
 * Null when no row is visible to this actor — no such attachment, an id that could not name one,
 * a channel that has since been deleted, or not theirs to see, the same answer for all four as on
 * the fetch route. `resolvePart` turns that into a failed turn naming the id, which is the correct
 * outcome: a turn that refers to an attachment the asker cannot see must not proceed to a model
 * that would read the file back to them.
 *
 * THIS USED TO STAMP `attachedAt`, and the reasoning was that a load past the membership join is
 * the closest thing to evidence of a send there is. It is not close enough, in two directions at
 * once. This function is called for the message being asked about AND for every attachment in the
 * history behind it, on every turn — so a read-time stamp said "sent" about every file anybody had
 * ever been shown, including one that is still staged in somebody's composer. And it is scoped to
 * MEMBERSHIP, because members are meant to see each other's sent files, so any member could freeze
 * a colleague's staged row by naming its id in a message of their own: that row then answered the
 * colleague's own withdrawal with a 409 for ever and the sweeper would never reclaim it either.
 *
 * The send writes the column instead. It goes out through AG-UI rather than through either router
 * in this file, so the write is made where the send is actually known to have happened — in
 * `inlineAttachments` (copilot.ts), which is the one place that can tell the message being asked
 * about from the history behind it — through {@link markAttachmentsSent}.
 *
 * IT DOES READ `attachedAt`, THOUGH, WHICH IS NEW. A staged row is a file nobody has shared with
 * anybody yet, so it is its uploader's alone until a send says otherwise; a sent one belongs to the
 * conversation and every member of the channel may read it. The asymmetry used to run one way only:
 * the comment below explains at length why a reader must not WRITE a colleague's staged row, and
 * then let any member read one.
 *
 * AND SCOPED TO THE TURN'S OWN CHANNEL, which it did not used to be. See
 * {@link inTheTurnsChannel} for the shape and for why it degrades on an unmapped thread instead of
 * refusing. What it closes: somebody in channels A and B could put an id from A on a message they
 * compose in B, and this returned the bytes. They already hold that file, so it was never
 * escalation — but it left a message in B whose file lives in a channel B has nothing to do with,
 * and the day A is deleted that message's attachment is permanently broken in B while the row is
 * still there. The run carries the thread id, so the channel behind it is knowable here now.

/**
 * Records that these attachments went out in a message, on behalf of the person who sent it.
 *
 * WRITTEN BY THE SENDER, NOT BY A READER. `attachedAt` means one thing — "this file rode in a
 * message somebody actually sent" — and three readers depend on that one meaning:
 * `cull-staged-attachments.ts` treats a null as a staged file nobody came back for and eventually
 * deletes it; the upload route above treats a null as a slot still occupied against
 * `MAX_ATTACHMENTS_PER_MESSAGE`; and `DELETE /api/attachments/:id` treats a non-null as a promise
 * to a sent message and refuses to withdraw the file. A column written as a side effect of reading
 * cannot carry that meaning, because reading is not sending: history is replayed in full on every
 * turn, for whoever happens to be running it, so a read-time stamp says "sent" about every file
 * anybody has ever been shown.
 *
 * SCOPED TO THE UPLOADER, and that is a second, separate reason a read may not write this. Reading
 * is scoped to CHANNEL MEMBERSHIP, because members are supposed to see each other's sent files —
 * so a stamp on the read path let any member freeze a colleague's still-staged row simply by naming
 * its id in a message of their own. That row then answers the colleague's own DELETE with a 409 for
 * ever, and the sweeper will not reclaim it either, because both of those read `attachedAt` and
 * `attachedAt` now says the file was sent. Only the uploader's own send may stamp the uploader's
 * own row, so `uploadedBy` is in the WHERE beside the id.
 *
 * `isNull(attachments.attachedAt)` keeps the FIRST send, not the most recent one. A message is
 * replayed as history on every later turn and a stopped run is retried; neither is a new send, and
 * neither should move a timestamp that already means something.
 *
 * Ids that could not name a row are dropped before the query rather than passed to it. These come
 * out of `attachmentIdFor` (attachment-parts.ts), which slices whatever follows
 * `/api/attachments/` in a browser-supplied message part, so a query string, a second path segment
 * and the empty string all arrive here as "ids" — and comparing text that is not uuid-shaped
 * against a `uuid` column raises Postgres `22P02` and throws, exactly as it would in
 * {@link loadAttachmentForTurn}. Nothing left to ask about is not a query at all.
 *
 * AND SCOPED TO THE TURN'S OWN CHANNEL, by the same {@link inTheTurnsChannel} term the reader uses,
 * for a harm that was reproduced rather than reasoned about. A person in channels A and B could
 * name an id from A on a message they sent in B, and this stamped the row in A. Nothing in A ever
 * referred to it, and yet it was now un-withdrawable — the withdrawal route refuses a sent
 * attachment with a 409 — and unsweepable, because the culler only reclaims rows with a null
 * `attachedAt`. The person was left holding a file they could neither use nor get rid of, in a
 * channel that had never seen it. That is the same shape as the freeze the `uploadedBy` term above
 * exists to prevent, reached from the other direction.
 *
 * THE SAME TERM AS THE READER, NOT A STRICTER ONE, and that was a decision. A stricter write — an
 * inner join, so an unmapped thread stamps nothing — is unreachable for a hop (a hop's asked
 * message is `handoff-delivery.ts`'s synthetic instruction, which names no attachment, so the
 * `ids.length === 0` return above fires first) and so looked free. It was rejected because on the
 * one surface where it IS reachable, the direct `/bot` chat, it fails in exactly the direction this
 * column's whole purpose is to avoid: a file that really was sent silently never gets stamped, and
 * the culler deletes it a day later out from under a conversation that shows it. One rule, stated
 * once, is also one rule to keep true.
 *
 * IT RAISES WHEN IT CANNOT PROVE THE STAMP LANDED, AND IT USED TO SWALLOW. The sentence that stood
 * here said that a turn is a person waiting for an answer, and that bookkeeping which could not be
 * written is not worth failing that answer over. The first half is true. The second rested on a
 * premise that is false: that by the time this runs, the answer has been earned. It has not.
 * `inlineAttachments` (copilot.ts) calls this BEFORE it hands the history back, and that history is
 * what `super.run` / `next.run` is given afterwards — so at this moment no model has been called, no
 * token has been spent, and the person's message is still in front of them. Raising here costs a
 * retry of something that never started.
 *
 * Staying silent costs the FILE. The culler reclaims every row whose `attachedAt` is null, so a turn
 * that answered happily about an attachment it never stamped leaves a message displaying a file the
 * sweeper deletes a day later; the upload cap keeps counting the slot for ever in the meantime. That
 * damage is permanent, silent, and lands on somebody who did nothing but send a file. An answer
 * somebody can ask for again is the cheaper of the two losses, and this is called at the one point
 * in the turn where that trade is still on offer — which is why the third option, refusing before
 * the turn is spent, beats both halves of the dilemma rather than splitting it.
 *
 * Refusing here is also not a new KIND of outcome on this path. `resolvePart`'s `"fail"` mode
 * already refuses this same turn at this same moment when the asked message names a file that
 * cannot be loaded or cannot be afforded — same reason, same recovery, same sentence-shaped error.
 *
 * WHAT STILL DOES NOT RAISE, because the old swallow was not protecting nothing:
 *
 *  - AN ID THAT COULD NEVER NAME A ROW, dropped before the query as before. A browser part that is
 *    not an attachment reference is not a failed send.
 *  - NOTHING TO RECORD, which is still not a query at all.
 *  - HISTORY. Only the asked message's ids are passed in, so nothing behind it is stamped or
 *    checked, and a replayed thread does not acquire new ways to fail.
 *  - A ROW THAT IS ALREADY SENT. An `attachedAt` that is already set is a SUCCESS here, not a race
 *    lost: a stopped run retried and a message replayed are both ordinary, and a rule that failed
 *    them would be failing people for doing nothing wrong.
 *
 * ZERO UPDATED ROWS IS NOT WHAT IT CHECKS. Postgres reports an UPDATE that matched nothing as a
 * successful command (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-update.html#SQL-UPDATE-OUTPUTS),
 * so the count is silent about the failure that matters — and it is also the wrong question, in both
 * directions. It reads zero for a row that was already stamped, which is a success, and zero for a
 * colleague's already-sent file named on this message, which the `uploadedBy` term above correctly
 * declines to touch. What has to be true is not "this statement changed something" but "this id is,
 * NOW, durably recorded as sent in this conversation", so the UPDATE is followed by a SELECT asking
 * exactly that, and every id that cannot answer it is named in the refusal.
 *
 * THAT SELECT DOES NOT REPEAT THE READER'S MEMBERSHIP JOIN, deliberately. Whether this actor may
 * see these files was settled by {@link loadAttachmentForTurn} earlier in the same turn, and a
 * second, subtly different copy of an access rule is a thing to keep in step rather than a check.
 * What is asked here is only what this function is responsible for — the row still exists, it is
 * stamped, and it is in this turn's channel.
 *
 * THE SELECT IS A SECOND STATEMENT, NOT A CTE HANGING OFF THE UPDATE, and that is the whole of the
 * idempotence. A data-modifying CTE and the query reading beside it share one snapshot, taken when
 * the statement began — so a row a neighbouring session stamped a moment ago is invisible to the
 * read, while the UPDATE's own re-check correctly declines to stamp it twice. Two concurrent runs of
 * the same message, or a retry overlapping the run it retries, would then refuse each other. Under
 * READ COMMITTED a separate statement takes a fresh snapshot and sees the neighbour's commit, which
 * is the answer that is actually true.
 *
 * IN A TRANSACTION, SO A REFUSED SEND LEAVES NO STAMPS BEHIND. A message may name several files and
 * only one of them need be missing. Keeping the others' stamps would record a send for a turn that
 * never ran, which is the exact freeze the paragraphs above are about: un-withdrawable, unsweepable,
 * and referred to by nothing. Throwing inside the transaction rolls them back, so a refusal puts the
 * rows back as the turn found them and the person's retry starts from a clean state.
 *
 * NO ADVISORY LOCK, AND THAT WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The upload route holds
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock` because it counts rows and then inserts against that count, which is two
 * facts that must not drift apart. There is no count here. The stamp and the two things that can
 * take the row out from under it — `DELETE /api/attachments/:id` and
 * `server/scripts/cull-staged-attachments.ts`, both of which carry `attached_at is null` in their
 * own WHERE — contend for the same ROW, and a row lock already serialises them: whichever commits
 * second re-evaluates its own predicate against the row as it then stands. Withdrawal first, and
 * this UPDATE matches nothing while the SELECT finds no row, so the send is refused. Stamp first,
 * and the withdrawal's `attached_at is null` no longer holds so it deletes nothing, which is the 409
 * pinned by "a send landing mid-request cannot have its file deleted out from under it" in
 * attachment-routes.test.ts. They cannot both win. An advisory lock would be a second, weaker
 * mechanism laid over the one Postgres already applies to the row itself.
 *
 * The log names the actor and the ids, because every consequence of a missing stamp — a file the
 * sweeper reclaims, a slot that never frees — is about a specific person and a specific row, and a
 * line naming neither cannot be acted on. The raised message names the ids as well. There is no
 * `app.onError` behind this server, but this refusal never becomes a response status: it leaves
 * through the run as an AG-UI error, the road `resolvePart`'s refusals already take, so what the
 * composer receives is the sentence rather than a plain-text 500.

 * a bucket the CLIENT names: `uploadGroup` arrives as a form field, `uploadGroupOf` deliberately
 * does not validate its value, and a caller that mints a fresh one on every request therefore has
 * zero prior rows in every bucket it is ever counted against. The cap never fires, and nothing else
 * bounded staged `bytea` — the only remaining ceilings were the ~8 MB per-request body limit and
 * `scripts/cull-staged-attachments.ts`, whose default window is 24 hours. Reproduced through this
 * route before it was closed: 33 uploads, a fresh `newId()`-shaped group on each, 33 rows written.
 *
 * PER UPLOADER, ACROSS ALL CHANNELS, and both halves of that were forced.
 *
 * - Per uploader rather than per deployment, because a deployment-wide ceiling is a ceiling one
 *   person can sit on: fill it and every colleague's upload is refused for a sentence naming
 *   nothing they did. It also makes every upload contend on one counter.
 * - Across all channels rather than per channel, because `POST /api/channels` is open to any
 *   authenticated user (`channels/routes.ts`). A per-channel backstop is a backstop a client moves
 *   by creating a channel, which is the same defect as one it moves by choosing a string — a few
 *   more bytes per bucket, still unbounded.
 *
 * ROWS RATHER THAN BYTES, which was the harder call. A row here is at most
 * `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` (8 MiB), so counting rows bounds bytes too, at 32 x 8 MiB = 256 MiB of staged
 * blobs per person — a real bound, derived rather than declared. A separate `sum(size_bytes)`
 * ceiling was written and dropped: it buys a tighter storage number at the cost of a second limit
 * to keep honest, a second refusal sentence for a person to make sense of, and a test that has to
 * push a quarter of a gigabyte through the route to prove it. If the byte ceiling ever needs to be
 * independent of the file ceiling — an attachment kind larger than 8 MiB, say — that is the moment
 * to add it, and this comment is where to say so.
 *
 * FOUR MESSAGES' WORTH, deliberately loose. Ordinary work never comes near it: the composer refuses
 * a ninth file per message, so reaching 32 means four full eight-file messages composed and left
 * unsent at the same time, inside the sweeper's 24-hour window. Two tabs — the case the per-group
 * cap exists to serve — is sixteen. The looseness is the point: this number is not meant to be the
 * limit anybody experiences, only the one nobody can walk past.
 *
 * NO NEW INDEX, AND THAT WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The count this drives asks
 * `uploaded_by = ? and attached_at is null`, and the obvious worry is that it degrades with an
 * uploader's HISTORY — `attachments_uploaded_by_idx` covers every row they ever uploaded, almost
 * all of them long since sent. It does not, because a better index already exists for it:
 * `attachments_staged_idx` is partial on `attached_at is null`, so it holds only the staged rows in
 * the deployment. Measured on this deployment's Postgres with 50,000 SENT rows for one uploader,
 * the planner takes that partial index and filters `uploaded_by` inside it — one shared buffer,
 * 0.011 ms. The set it scans is the deployment's staged rows, which the sweeper keeps short-lived
 * and which THIS CONSTANT now bounds per person, so the query gets cheaper for the same reason it
 * exists. A partial index on `(uploaded_by) where attached_at is null` would be tighter still; it
 * is not worth a migration until a deployment is seen where it is.
 *
 * WHAT IT CAN COST AN HONEST PERSON, stated because a backstop that cannot be reached honestly is
 * not the same as one that cannot be reached awkwardly. Staged rows in a channel that was
 * soft-deleted, or that this person was removed from, cannot be withdrawn (`DELETE
 * /api/attachments/:id` joins live channels and membership), so they hold their place until the
 * sweeper takes them — which is as long as this deployment's operator has configured, and for ever
 * if they have turned the sweep off. Thirty-two of those would refuse the next upload anywhere for
 * that whole time. That is the same shape of fault the per-channel cap used to have at EIGHT, which
 * is precisely why this sits four times higher, and why the refusal names the deployment rather than
 * a deadline it cannot promise.

 * The longest group this route will count a row under.

 * A real client sends `newId()`, which is a 36-character UUID, so nothing legitimate comes within
 * an order of magnitude of this. What the bound is really for is that a longer one FAILS rather
 * than merely wasting space: `upload_group` is the third column of `attachments_upload_group_idx`
 * (schema/core.ts), and a btree entry may not exceed about 2704 bytes. An incompressible group of
 * 2600 bytes makes the INSERT itself fail — measured against this deployment's Postgres, 2000 bytes
 * stored fine and 2600, 2700, 3000 and 8000 all raised.
 *
 * WHERE THAT FAILURE LANDS, SINCE THIS COMMENT USED TO GET IT WRONG. It claimed the group was also
 * interpolated into the `pg_advisory_xact_lock` key, so that an unstorable one failed there instead,
 * "one statement earlier, and before the insert is even attempted". That was true while the lock was
 * keyed on `(channel, uploader, group)`; the lock was since widened to the uploader alone — the key
 * is `attachment-cap-<actorId>` and carries no group at all — and the sentence was left behind.
 * Re-measured: the advisory lock takes an 8000-byte group and a NUL-bearing one without complaint.
 *
 * The group's first and only appearance is the upload's own CTE statement, which counts and inserts
 * together, so an over-long group is refused by the index at the moment the insert runs and there is
 * no earlier statement for it to fail in. Nothing is written either way, and the transaction's
 * `.catch` turns the raise into the route's 503 rather than into a plain-text 500.
 *

 * A channel's upload door: one file in, one staged row out, or a reason it was refused.

 * THE TRADE-OFF THE GROUPING MAKES, WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE IT IS A REAL BEHAVIOUR CHANGE. The cap
 * counted every unsent row this person had in this channel; it now counts the ones staged by one
 * composer session. Two tabs open on the same channel are two sessions, so they get eight each
 * rather than eight between them. That is accepted deliberately: the cap is documented and enforced
 * as a PER-MESSAGE limit everywhere else (`MAX_ATTACHMENTS_PER_MESSAGE`, and the composer's own
 * screen), two tabs are two messages, and the alternative — the per-channel count — is what made a
 * closed tab's leftovers refuse a pick the client had already accepted, naming files nobody could
 * see. A cap that occasionally allows a second message's worth is a far smaller fault than one that
 * bricks uploads in a channel for 24 hours.
 *
 * THAT PARAGRAPH DESCRIBED HALF THE PICTURE UNTIL `MAX_STAGED_ATTACHMENTS_PER_UPLOADER` EXISTED.
 * "A second bucket of eight" is what a second TAB gets. It is not what a CALLER gets, because the
 * bucket is named by a form field this route does not validate: a fresh group on every request has
 * nothing in it to count, so the cap never fires, and the number of buckets is however many strings
 * the caller cares to type. Nothing else bounded staged `bytea` — the body limit is per request,
 * and the culler runs on a 24-hour window — so one authenticated member could stage without limit
 * into the only table in this deployment that holds blobs. Reproduced through this route before it
 * was closed, not argued from the code.
 *
 * SO THERE ARE TWO NUMBERS NOW, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF NUMBER. The cap is the one the
 * composer knows, shows and is refused by, counted over a bucket the client names — because the set
 * on the screen is the only set the client can reason about. The backstop is counted over every
 * unsent row one person holds, in every channel and every group, because that is the only scope a
 * client cannot move. It sits four messages higher so that everything the paragraph above accepts —
 * two tabs, a closed tab's leftovers, a stopped run — still fits comfortably underneath it. The
 * trade survives; what it no longer does is run to infinity.
 *
 * The refusal is the point of this route as much as the upload is. `classifyAttachment` and
 * `sniffMimeType` between them already decide, byte-for-byte, whether a file is something a Bot can
 * read; this handler's job is to turn "no" into a sentence a person sees, naming what the file
 * actually was rather than "unsupported file type" — the composer surfaces the string verbatim, so
 * it is the only explanation anybody gets.
 *
 * Mounted at `/api/channels` by whoever wires the app together; this file only builds the router.

     * into the insert's own `where` means no row can be written by a statement whose count did not
     * permit it. But under READ COMMITTED that count still runs against a snapshot taken before the
     * other transaction committed, so two such statements can still each see seven. The advisory
     * lock is what makes the counts authoritative: it serialises every upload by one uploader, so
     * the second one's counts are both taken after the first one's row is committed and visible.
     *
     * THE KEY IS THE UPLOADER, AND IT USED TO BE (channel, uploader, group). That was the right
     * scope while the group cap was the only thing being counted, and it is the wrong scope now:
     * `MAX_STAGED_ATTACHMENTS_PER_UPLOADER` is counted over everything one person has staged, so a
     * lock keyed on the group serialises the uploads that share a bucket and nothing else — which
     * is to say it serialises none of the uploads a client varying its group sends. Two of those
     * arriving together would both count 31, both pass, and the person would hold 33: the same
     * READ COMMITTED hole the cap itself had to be fixed for, rebuilt one level up.
     *
     * Widening it costs one person's own parallel uploads their parallelism ACROSS TABS AND
     * CHANNELS rather than only within one composer. That is cheap where it lands: the bytes are
     * already off the wire, sniffed and classified before this transaction opens, so what takes
     * turns is one INSERT each, and eight files dropped on one composer already took turns here.
     * Nobody else's uploads wait on this person's.
     *
     * One lock rather than two — an uploader lock plus the old group lock — because the wider one
     * strictly contains the narrower: holding it makes BOTH counts authoritative, and a second lock
     * would add a second round trip and an acquisition order to get wrong.
     *
     * Transaction-scoped (`_xact_`), so the commit or the rollback releases it rather than us
     * remembering to. `hashtext` collisions are harmless: two unrelated uploaders sharing a hash
     * take turns, which is slower and not wrong.
     *
     * THE MEMBERSHIP IS IN THE SAME STATEMENT, for the same reason and against a slower race. The
     * handler checks membership at the top and used to insert on the strength of what it had read —
     * with `await file.arrayBuffer()`, the sniff and the classification in between, so the window is
     * as wide as reading an upload off the wire, not as wide as a scheduler tick. A removal landing
     * in it put a file into a channel its uploader had just been taken out of. Selecting the row to
     * insert FROM the channel-and-membership join closes that: the values are only produced if the
     * join still produces a row when the insert runs, so there is no moment at which a non-member's
     * file can land.

 * THE CONDITION IS THE ACCESS CHECK. It holds only when this attachment exists, the channel it was
 * uploaded into has not been deleted, and this actor has a membership row on that channel. No row,
 * for any of those reasons, is a 404 rather than a 403: a 403 would mean "yes, that id exists, but
 * it is not yours", which is a free bit of information for somebody probing ids for attachments they
 * cannot see. 404 is the same answer for "no such attachment", "the channel is gone" and "not
 * yours", so guessing ids learns nothing either way.
 *
 * `channels` is inside the `EXISTS` beside the membership, and not only the membership, because
 * channels soft-delete: the channel row and every membership on it outlive the deletion, so a
 * membership-only test says yes for ever and the bytes stay downloadable — and inlinable — after the
 * channel they belong to is gone.
 *
 * AND A STAGED ROW IS ITS UPLOADER'S ALONE. Membership is what lets people see each other's SENT
 * files; a row with no `attachedAt` has been shared with nobody, so a colleague's half-composed
 * draft is not a channel's to read. Reaching one needs its v4 uuid, which only the uploader's own
 * 201 ever carried, so this is a boundary rather than a leak anybody has — but it is the boundary
 * the write side already assumes, and the read side used not to keep.
 *
 * On the ordinary send that costs nothing: the stamp is written before the message is persisted, so
 * by the time another member's browser can name the id the row is no longer staged. What it does
 * change is the turns that fail before the stamp — a Bot that is no longer registered, a run that
 * throws mid-inline — where the message is persisted anyway and the row stays staged for ever.
 * Their attachments now read "unavailable" to everybody but the sender rather than being served out
 * of a draft nobody sent. That is the more honest answer of the two, and the underlying leak — a
 * persisted message whose rows were never stamped — is a copilot.ts fault worth fixing on its own.
 *
 * A CONDITION RATHER THAN A WHOLE QUERY, WHICH IS WHAT LETS THE THREE READS DIFFER IN NOTHING BUT
 * THEIR COLUMNS. The fetch wants the bytes, the probe wants the size, and a revalidation wants
 * nothing at all — and until this was factored out, each of them carried its own copy of the joins
 * and the WHERE. That is a standing invitation to drift: a rule added to one and not the others
 * turns `HEAD` into a way to learn that an id exists, or that a colleague has a draft, which the
 * uniform 404 exists to hide. Stated once, there is no second copy to leave behind. A helper that
 * owned the columns too was written first and abandoned: drizzle tracks the legal builder methods in
 * the selection's own type, and over a generic selection TypeScript cannot resolve that, so the
 * joins would not chain.
 *
 * AS A CORRELATED `EXISTS` RATHER THAN AS TWO INNER JOINS, which is the shape the withdrawal below
 * already uses for the same rule. A condition composes where a join does not — that is the whole
 * reason this is reusable — and it cannot multiply the attachment row if a membership is ever

     * THE VALIDATOR IS KNOWN BEFORE THE ROW IS, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES A 304 CHEAP.

     * An attachment's bytes never change once stored — nothing in this file or anywhere else
     * updates `attachments.bytes` — so a given id names one exact representation for as long as it
     * names anything. A strong ETag of the id therefore needs no digest of the file to compute, and
     * no row either: whether the client's `If-None-Match` still holds is decidable HERE, before a
     * single column has been chosen.
     *
     * It used to be asked after the row came back, with `bytes` already in the select list, so every
     * revalidation read the whole file out of Postgres in order to send an empty body. The comment
     * that stood here called that "the cost of keeping the authorisation and the answer in one
     * statement", which was a false trade: the two were never in tension, because the validator
     * never needed the row.
     *
     * NOR IS IT A CORNER. {@link ATTACHMENT_CACHE_CONTROL} is `private, no-cache` deliberately, so
     * EVERY image paint in every viewing member's transcript revalidates here — the 304 is the
     * common path on this route, not the rare one. Measured through this route against an 8 MiB
     * attachment, 12 runs each side: 8,388,608 bytes read and 25.09ms median per 304 before, 0 bytes
     * and 0.65ms after.
     *
     * WHAT IS NOT GIVEN UP IS THE AUTHORISATION. The question a conditional request answers on this
     * route is not "have the bytes changed" — they cannot — but "is this still there and still
     * yours", so a 304 is still earned by the same channel-and-membership join a 200 is, in the same
     * single statement. Somebody removed from the channel gets 404 on their next revalidation, not
     * 304. Only the blob left the select list; the decision did not.
     *
     * AND IT IS ASKED AHEAD OF THE `HEAD` BRANCH, so the probe gets the same saving and the same
     * answer from the same lines. A revalidating HEAD and a revalidating GET differ in nothing but
     * the body Hono strips, which is what "the probe answers exactly what the fetch would" is
     * supposed to mean.

     * `routes.on("HEAD", ...)` handler is therefore never reached — that was written first and

     * handler Hono actually calls. The REQUEST object is passed through untouched, which is why
     * the method is still readable at this point.
     *
     * It is worth answering cheaply. The transcript probes every document tile it draws with
     * `HEAD /api/attachments/<id>`, from every viewing member's browser, and
     * {@link ATTACHMENT_CACHE_CONTROL} is `no-cache`, so each probe re-ran a full `bytea` read of a
     * file nobody was going to be sent — measured: a HEAD of an 8 MiB attachment came back 200 with
     * an empty body, having read all 8 MiB out of Postgres.
     *
     * Same access decision and the same headers — `size_bytes` in place of `bytes`, and
     * `Content-Length` set by hand because a body-less response has nothing to derive it from and
     * the size is the thing a probe is usually asking for. The refusals have to be indistinguishable
     * from the fetch's, or a probe becomes a way to learn something a fetch would not tell you, so
     * they are not repeated here at all: {@link readVisibleAttachment} makes the decision and
     * {@link noSuchAttachment} and {@link couldNotReadAttachment} phrase both of its refusals, for
     * this branch and the fetch below alike. `attachment-routes.test.ts` still asserts that case by
     * case rather than leaving it to this comment.
     *
     * Revalidation is not handled here either, because the branch above already answered it for both
     * methods before this one was reached.

     * element at a time on the single JS thread: 8.4 million steps for a file at `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`.
     * Measured on this repo's Bun 1.4 over an 8 MiB buffer: `Uint8Array.from` 62-87ms, this view
     * 0.0004ms, `new Uint8Array(buffer)` (a copy, no iterator) 0.13ms. End to end, one 8 MiB fetch
     * through this route went from 120-140ms to 36-38ms.
     *
     * That cost lands where it hurts most. {@link ATTACHMENT_CACHE_CONTROL} is `no-cache`

     *
     * The offset and the length are both passed, rather than `new Uint8Array(row.bytes.buffer)`,
     * because a `Buffer` need not own the whole of its `ArrayBuffer`: Node pools small allocations,
     * so a short row can arrive as a window into a larger block. Dropping the offset would serve
     * whatever else shares that block. The bytes are not copied, which is safe because nothing here
     * or downstream writes through this view.
     *
     * The cast narrows `ArrayBufferLike` to `ArrayBuffer`, which is the only difference between
     * what Node's `Buffer` promises and what hono's `Data` accepts: `ArrayBufferLike` admits a
     * `SharedArrayBuffer`, and a database driver decoding a `bytea` off a socket does not allocate
     * one. It is a type-level narrowing with no run-time step, which is the whole point — the

     * the third party that fits in it: stamp the row after the read and before the delete, and the
     * file goes out from under a message that already claims it, leaving the transcript pointing at
     * nothing. The window is not theoretical — it is the sender's own turn racing their own
     * composer, which still offers the file for withdrawal until the send is recorded.
     *
     * Stating the whole rule in the WHERE closes it, because Postgres re-checks that WHERE against
     * the row as it stands when the delete actually gets the row: `attachedAt IS NULL` no longer
     * holds, nothing is deleted, and the returning list is empty. There is no moment at which a
     * sent attachment is deletable.
     *
     * `uploadedBy` for the reason it was there before. Membership only ever gated visibility, and a
     * sent attachment is refused below regardless of who asks; what membership-only scoping still
     * allowed was a member deleting a colleague's *unsent* draft, which does real damage — the
     * colleague's composer keeps pointing at a now-missing row, and their send fails later when
     * nothing can resolve it. A non-uploader gets the same 404 as a non-member.
     *
     * A LIVE CHANNEL AND MEMBERSHIP ON IT, AS A CORRELATED `EXISTS` RATHER THAN AS A JOIN, because
     * the join this route used to lead with lived in a separate SELECT and a delete cannot carry
     * one. It is here because "is a member of this live channel" is an access-control boundary, and

     * still-unsent draft — is low-harm enough that letting it through would be a boundary loosened

     * still evaluated at the moment the row is taken.

     * membership-only test kept saying yes and this route kept acting inside a channel nobody can
     * open. Same scope as the fetch route above and as the upload route, which is what makes "the
