 * better — every computer action is recorded with the same facts the gateway judged it on — so a
 * candidate policy can be replayed over that history and answer, before it is saved, "these are the
 * actions you would have decided differently."
 *
 * Replay, not simulation: the context handed to `evaluateActionPolicy` here is rebuilt from the
 * audit row exactly as the gateway built it at decision time, through the same helpers. A rule that
 * behaves one way here and another way live would make this feature worse than absent.
