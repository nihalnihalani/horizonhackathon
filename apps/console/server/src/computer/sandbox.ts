/**
 * A computer each, as a `Sandbox` on Kubernetes.
 *
 * `kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox` defines a CRD for "isolated, stateful singleton workloads with
 * stable identity and persistent storage", aimed at agents that run untrusted code and drive
 * graphical interfaces. That is a description of a Bot's computer, so this provider maps onto it
 * rather than hand-rolling a StatefulSet per Bot and owning suspend, resume and identity ourselves.
 *
 * The part that would have been the hard build is a field. `spec.operatingMode` is `Running` or
 * `Suspended`, and Suspended terminates the pod while keeping the volumes, so "spin down when idle,
 * come back with the logins intact" is one patch and a condition to wait on.
 *
 * NO CLIENT LIBRARY. The Kubernetes API is HTTP and JSON, this needs five verbs of it, and a
 * generated client would be a large dependency in an image that already ships a browser. The
 * in-cluster service account gives a token and a CA, which is what `inClusterConfig` reads.
