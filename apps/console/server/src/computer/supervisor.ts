/**
 * Where a Bot's computer lives, asked of the supervisor.
 *
 * Each Bot gets a container of its own, which means the address of a computer is no longer one
 * fixed URL, it is whatever port the supervisor published for that Bot, and it changes when the
 * computer is reset. So the server stops holding an address and starts asking for one.
 *
 * The server still never touches Docker. It asks for a Bot's computer by Bot; the supervisor decides
 * what that means. Everything the API server can express is in this file, and it is four verbs.
 *
 * Without a supervisor configured, nothing here is used and the fixed `AGENT_COMPUTER_URL` still
 * answers for every Bot. That is the single-container mode: fine for one person on a laptop, and
 * honest about being one shared computer.
