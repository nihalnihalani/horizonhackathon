/**
 * The vault answered, and what it holds cannot be spent: the row is gone, or it is revoked.

 * not open, an envelope that would not decrypt — is a fault, and a caller must be able to tell the
 * two apart without reading either message.
 *
 * REASON. The two used to be plain `Error`s and the only thing separating them from a fault was
 * their wording, which `plugins/store.ts` matched on: a message containing "revoked" or "not found"
 * was a withdrawal, anything else was an error. drizzle reports a failed query as a message that
 * BEGINS `Failed query: select "encrypted_value", "revoked_at" from "credentials" …`, so the column
 * this function reads put the substring into every database fault on this very read — Postgres
 * down, a wrong address, a cancelled statement — and each was announced to the person, the model and
 * the operator as an administrator having taken the credential away. A class cannot be produced by
 * accident that way, and it survives a reworded sentence, which is the same argument
 * `TokenRefusedError` carries a `code` for rather than a phrase in its prose.
 *
 * ONE CLASS FOR BOTH STATES, because no caller acts on the difference: the row being absent and the
 * row being retired are both "this credential is not available and will not become available", and
 * the step is the same. The messages stay distinct for whoever is reading a log.
