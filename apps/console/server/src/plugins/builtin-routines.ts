 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER TRANSPORT. There is no vendor. `mcp` dials somebody
 * else's server and `google-drive-rest` dials Google; both answer to a credential, and who holds it
 * is settled before the connection is built. Here there is no credential at all — the call runs
 * against this deployment's own tables — so the ACTOR is not context, it is the authorization. That
 * is why {@link callTool} refuses a run that is not attributed to a person, and why the owner and
 * the Bot are read off the connection and never out of the arguments.
 *
 * It implements the same interface as the other two, as module-level exports, because that is the
 * shape {@link ./transport} resolves: a `TransportKind` maps to a MODULE. Which is also why the store
 * arrives through {@link useRoutineTools} rather than through a constructor — see the comment there.

 * stub and the real boot can install the store, and neither has to know about the other.

 * wrong schedule that keeps being wrong on a timer. So the cron contract is written out in full,
 * with worked examples, rather than left to a field named `cron`.
 *
 * HOW THE INSTRUCTION IS PHRASED IS PART OF THAT CONTRACT, and it was learned the hard way: a
 * routine stored as "Every run, append the current date and time to the Notion page …" fired, and the
 * turn read its own schedule-shaped text as a question about SCHEDULING — it checked that the routine
 * existed, said so, and appended nothing, successfully. `routines/run-turn.ts` now frames the firing
 * turn as a firing; this is the other half, so the sentence is written as work to begin with.
