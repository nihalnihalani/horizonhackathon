/**
 * The one file in `server/src` that imports `@composio/core`, and what it owes the rest of them.
 *
 * `./composio` describes calling an action and `./broker` describes everything that has to be true
 * before one can be called; both are written as narrow projections that name no vendor type, so
 * that the SDK's shape — its constructor, its retries, its zod schemas and whatever the next
 * version renames — is confined here. This module is the adapter that satisfies both from one
 * client. A second importer of `@composio/core` under `server/src` would undo that, because the
 * point of a single import site is that a version bump has exactly one file to be read against.
 *
 * NO SESSION IS EVER CREATED, AND THAT IS A SECURITY BOUNDARY RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE. The SDK's
 * `composio.create(...)` and `sessions.create(...)` open a Composio tool-router session, and a
 * session brings Composio's own hosted surface with it — a remote shell and a Python sandbox that
 * this deployment neither asked for, cannot see into, and could not audit if a model reached them.
 * Everything below is a plain per-call request carrying a user id. A `create` of a session
 * anywhere in this file is a defect, not an optimisation, and it will not look like one: the
 * session API is the shortest path to most of what this file does the long way.
 *
 * EVERY LISTING PASSES AN EXPLICIT LIMIT AND EVERY LISTING IS READ TO THE END OF ITS CURSOR.
 * Composio's default page is 20, which is smaller than the number of actions Gmail alone publishes,
 * and through the SDK's tool wrapper the default did a second thing as well: `getRawComposioTools`
 * set `important=true` whenever a toolkit query arrived with no limit, no tags and no search
 * (`@composio/core` 0.18.1, `src/models/Tools.ts:505-515`), so an omitted limit silently narrowed
 * the answer to the vendor's own "important" subset and nothing in the result said a filter had
 * been applied. {@link LISTING_LIMIT} is the documented page ceiling and therefore the fewest round
 * trips a listing can be read in.
 *
 * AND THE LIMIT IS A PAGE RATHER THAN THE ANSWER, WHICH IS WHAT CHANGED. Two of the four listings
 * here used to meet a full page and refuse it, because the SDK wrapper around them could not ask
 * for a second — one takes no cursor, the other drops the response's. That was never true of the
 * vendor: both raw endpoints carry `cursor` and `next_cursor`, and Composio publishes more than
 * {@link LISTING_LIMIT} toolkits, so the catalogue refusal fired on every call and the app picker
 * showed an operator nothing at all. All four now go through {@link everyRowOf}, which follows the
 * cursor until the vendor stops offering one and refuses rather than truncates when it cannot.
 *
 * THE API KEY NEVER LEAVES THIS FILE. It arrives as {@link createComposioClient}'s only argument,
 * goes straight into the vendor's constructor, and is held from there on by the vendor's client
 * inside a closure. Nothing below logs it, no thrown message quotes it, and neither of the two
 * returned objects carries a field that could be read back to it — they expose eight methods and
 * no state. A key in a log line is a key in a log aggregator, and a key in an error message is a
 * key in an audit row and in a model's context.

/**
 * One tool as the SDK's SINGLE-TOOL call hands it over, in as much detail as anything here reads.
 *

 * structural: a field this file does not read is a field a vendor rename cannot break. `toolkit`
 * is optional because the SDK spells it optional — see {@link ComposioActions.execute} below for
 * what is done when it is in fact missing.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONE ROW THE SDK STILL VALIDATES, AND IT IS NO LONGER TWO. `Tools.transformToolCases`
 * ends in `ToolSchema.parse(...)` (`@composio/core` 0.18.1, `src/models/Tools.ts:193`), a throwing
 * parse rather than the warn-only `transform()` every other answer here goes through, and
 * `getRawComposioToolBySlug` runs it (`:719`). The LISTING used to as well (`:561`) and does not
 * any more: it reads {@link VendorToolRow} off the raw client, because the wrapper that ran the
 * parse is also the wrapper that could not be paged. So `ToolkitSchema` spelling that inner `slug`
 * required (`src/types/tool.types.ts:12-16`) is a guarantee this declaration may still rest on,
 * and it is a guarantee about exactly one call.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE HANDS ON IS STILL `unknown`, WHICH IS WHERE THAT ARGUMENT ALWAYS STOPPED BEING
 * TRUE. A parse is a fact about one method of one version of one package, and what these
 * declarations govern is {@link ComposioVendor} — the seam a test satisfies with a literal and the
 * shape the next version will be read against. Running it shows the gap is not academic: a
 * `description` of 42 crosses into `./composio` as the `string` this said it was and reaches
 * `.replaceAll` in `./store` as a bare `TypeError`. A declaration is an assertion and not a check.

 * See {@link ComposioBroker.listApps} below for what each absence becomes.
 *
 * SNAKE_CASE AND `unknown` THROUGHOUT, BECAUSE THE TRANSFORMER THIS WAS WRITTEN AGAINST IS GONE.
 * The catalogue reads `client.toolkits.list` directly — see {@link ComposioVendor} for why it has
 * to — so `transformToolkitListResponse` no longer stands between Composio and {@link appOf}, and
 * three things it was doing have to be accounted for rather than assumed.
 *
 * IT RENAMED, so the count is `tools_count` here and the category's own word is `name`
 * (`@composio/client` 0.1.0-alpha.76, `resources/toolkits.d.ts:405-435`). That rename was the one
 * thing in this projection easiest to get silently wrong — a count read off the wrong key is a
 * plausible zero rather than an error — which is why {@link appOf} is where it is read and why a
 * test asserts the figure rather than the field.
 *
 * IT REBUILT `meta` AND THE `categories` LIST, spreading each into a fresh literal and mapping
 * every entry (`@composio/core` 0.18.1, `src/utils/transformers/toolkits.ts:21-34`). Those were
 * this file's two structural guarantees and they were real: a `meta` of null and a `categories` of
 * "crm" each raised a `TypeError` from that line when 0.18.1 was run, which is why neither was
 * declared `unknown` and neither was checked. Nothing raises now. A `meta` that is a string reads
 * as an app with no description, no logo, no categories and no count, and a `categories` that is a
 * string reads as an app in no category — two silent, plausible answers about a real app. Both are
 * declared at what the wire can hold and both are refused in {@link appOf}.
 *
 * AND IT NEVER VALIDATED, which is the part that does not change. `transform()` checks with
 * `safeParse` and, where that fails, logs a warning and returns the unvalidated object anyway
 * (`src/utils/transform.ts:26-36`), so `ToolKitItemSchema` spelling `name` required and the count a

 * identical. The name is the one field this deployment chooses, which is why {@link CONFIG_SUFFIX}
 * is written into it and why every decision below reads it.
 *

 * "does one exist" question, and a connect link minted against it does not work. The two facts have
 * to be separable or an app with a disabled config reads as an app that is ready.
 *
 * BOTH OF THOSE ARE DECLARED AS THE WIRE CAN SEND THEM RATHER THAN AS THE SDK SPELLS THEM, for the
 * reason the toolkit row above gives at length: `transformAuthConfigRetrieveResponse` copies

 * `transformAuthConfigRetrieveResponse` reads `authConfig.toolkit.logo` while building every row

 * WHERE THE LINE BETWEEN "READ AT ITS TYPE" AND "READ OUT OF `unknown`" IS DRAWN, AND WHY IT MOVED.

 * unvalidated object anyway (`@composio/core` 0.18.1, `src/utils/transform.ts:26-36`), so a
 * TypeScript declaration over a wire value is an assertion and not a check.
 *
 * THAT ARGUMENT IS TRUE OF THE FIELDS AND FALSE OF THE SHAPES AROUND THEM, which a round of running
 * the SDK against malformed answers established rather than reasoned about. `transform()` returns
 * whatever its TRANSFORMER built, and every one of these transformers builds its result by
 * dereferencing the raw answer — `response.items.map(...)`, `item.meta.categories`,
 * `authConfig.toolkit.logo`, `response.auth_config.id`. So the containers and the rows inside them
 * are the vendor's own construction and cannot arrive malformed; only the values copied ACROSS
 * those lines can, and those are exactly the fields declared `unknown` above. Guards were written
 * for both halves, and the ones covering the shapes were branches no answer could reach, standing
 * where the next reader would take them for what was keeping them safe.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS THEM SAFE IS `askVendor`. A shape the SDK could not read raises inside the SDK, and
 * the `TypeError` row in {@link vendorRefusal} turns that into a sentence — one guard, at the layer
 * where the fault actually surfaces, covering every shape rather than the four somebody listed.
 *
 * REFUSING RATHER THAN FILLING IN, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF THE ARGUMENT FOR THE FIELDS. A `?? ""`, a
 * `String(x)` or a cast does not make a malformed answer safe; it converts a fault this deployment
 * could have reported into an answer it gives wrongly, and the wrong answers are not small ones —
 * an app with no name in an administrator's picker, an action with no slug put in front of a model,
 * and the one that was actually happening: a delete sent with `undefined` where an account id belongs,
 * answered by Composio however it likes, after which the audit trail records that a person's access

 * is correct about the FIELDS and wrong about the CONTAINER, which running `@composio/core` 0.18.1
 * settles rather than reasons about. Every list transformer dereferences the answer before
 * returning it: `response.items.map(...)` in `transformAuthConfigListResponse`
 * (`src/utils/transformers/authConfigs.ts:79`), in `transformConnectedAccountListResponse`
 * (`connectedAccounts.ts:113`). So a container of the wrong shape — null, a bare list where an
 * envelope belongs, an `items` that is a string — dies inside the vendor's code and NEVER arrives
 * here. Each of those guards was therefore a branch no input could reach, sitting where the next
 * reader would take it for the thing keeping them safe.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS THEM SAFE IS ONE LAYER DOWN NOW. The vendor's crash is a bare `TypeError`, and

 * file does. The same two shapes therefore reach this code rather than dying in the vendor's, and

 * everywhere it is made: a guard is written where an input can reach it and nowhere else.

 * number was justified by one app's authorization configs and one person's accounts for one app:
 * at {@link LISTING_LIMIT} rows a page a second page is extraordinary there and a fiftieth is not
 * a data set. The app CATALOGUE is not that listing. Composio publishes more than
 * {@link LISTING_LIMIT} toolkits today, so it is a listing whose SECOND page is the ordinary case,
 * and a ceiling reasoned about from the narrow two would be sitting on top of a healthy answer
 * rather than above it.
 *
 * 200 IS CHOSEN AGAINST THE PAGE THE VENDOR MIGHT ACTUALLY SEND rather than the one asked for, and
 * that is the whole of the arithmetic. Asking for {@link LISTING_LIMIT} does not oblige Composio to
 * answer with it — the cursor is documented as "a base64 encoded string of the page and limit"
 * (`@composio/client` 0.1.0-alpha.76, `resources/toolkits.d.ts:469-478`), so the page size is the
 * vendor's to settle. At the page asked for, 200 is 200,000 rows, two orders of magnitude past any
 * catalogue Composio has published. At the vendor's OWN default page of twenty it is 4,000 rows,
 * which still clears today's catalogue with room — where 50 pages of twenty is 1,000, which is
 * today's catalogue exactly, and a ceiling that lands on the real answer is a healthy vendor turned
 * into a refusal. And 200 sequential requests is still a request that ends.
 *
 * ONE NUMBER FOR ALL FOUR LISTINGS, because the two narrow ones lose nothing by it: they refuse a
 * runaway cursor after 200 pages instead of 50, and there is no state in which a real answer to
 * either of those questions is even a second page. A per-listing ceiling would be a second number
 * to reason about in exchange for tightening a bound that nothing genuine approaches.
 *
 * AND IT IS THE NUMBER OF PAGES THAT ARE READ, WHICH IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE. The test stood
 * ahead of the line recording the page it was counting, so the set held one fewer than had

 * models forward it (`src/models/AuthConfigs.ts:95`, `src/models/ConnectedAccounts.ts:118`) and
 * both transformers fill `nextCursor` in from the response's `next_cursor`
 * (`src/utils/transformers/authConfigs.ts:80`, `connectedAccounts.ts:116`).
 *
 * AND THE CALLER THAT DECIDES IT IS `revoke`. Refusing a truncated listing would be honest and
 * would also mean that the person it happened to could never disconnect: every attempt would meet
 * the same page and the same refusal, with their grants standing the whole time. The removal of an
 * app is the same shape one level up. Reading the rest is the answer that finishes the job, and
 * refusing is what is left for the cases where reading the rest is not possible — which is what the
 * three refusals below are, and why none of them can be reached by a caller carrying a partial
 * answer that reports itself complete.
 *
 * THE FIRST REQUEST CARRIES NO CURSOR FIELD AT ALL rather than an undefined one, which is what
 * {@link everyRowOf}'s callers spread for: a `cursor: undefined` would reach the vendor's `parse`
 * as a key, and an explicit undefined is not something this file needs to make the SDK have an
 * opinion about.
 *
 * THERE WAS A FOURTH REFUSAL HERE AND IT MOVED RATHER THAN DIED, which is the correction the raw
 * client forces. It stood at the top of this loop for a page that is not an envelope at all, and
 * for the two SDK listings no answer can reach it: both transformers begin `response.items.map(...)`
 * (`src/utils/transformers/authConfigs.ts:79`, `connectedAccounts.ts:113`), so a null, a bare list
 * and an `items` that is not one all raise a `TypeError` inside the vendor's own code, answered
 * where it happens — see the `TypeError` row in {@link vendorRefusal}. Nothing dereferences the
 * answer on the two RAW listings, so for those the same shapes reach this loop, and
 * `rows.push(...answered.items)` over a string is "string is not iterable" with nothing in it a
 * person can act on. {@link pageOf} is where that is answered, at the two call sites that need it,
 * rather than as a branch every listing pays for and two of them cannot reach.
 *
 * What is left below are the three faults every one of the four can hand over, all of them about
 * the cursor, because the cursor is the one field nothing on any of these paths checks.
 *
 * AND A QUESTION ALREADY ANSWERED STOPS HERE, WHICH IS WHAT `enough` IS FOR. Paging made three of
 * this file's answers complete and made one of them FAILABLE: {@link ComposioBroker.isConnected}
 * returns a boolean, and the first page carrying a single row has settled it — no cursor Composio
 * could send next, and no fiftieth page, can turn that `true` into anything else. Reading on
 * anyway put the two cursor refusals and the page ceiling in front of a person whose account had
 * already been found, so a fault on a page nobody needed decided the answer to a question nobody
 * still had. The default reads every page, because that is what a withdrawal and a config listing
 * genuinely need; a caller that says when it has enough is a caller that cannot be failed after it
 * has its answer.
 *
 * CHECKED WHERE THE ROWS LAND AND BEFORE THE CURSOR IS LOOKED AT, deliberately. Reading the cursor
 * first and stopping afterwards would keep every one of the three refusals reachable on the page
 * that already answered the question, which is the whole of what this closes.

 * This person's accounts split into the ones a withdrawal can name and the ones it cannot.
 *
 * THE ID IS THE WHOLE OF WHAT A WITHDRAWAL NAMES, which is why it is read at all.
 * {@link ComposioBroker.revoke} deletes by id and then answers `true`, and `store.ts` writes that
 * answer into the audit trail as this person's access having been withdrawn before deleting the one
 * row in this deployment naming which app they had connected. An id-less account reaching the
 * delete is a request to withdraw `undefined` — which the vendor is free to read as anything at all
 * — followed by a `true`, a trail entry, and a live grant with nothing left pointing at it.
 *
 * PARTITIONED RATHER THAN THROWN, AND THAT IS THE CORRECTION. This reader used to refuse, and the
 * caller mapped EVERY row through it before sending a single delete — so one row whose id Composio
 * omitted threw ahead of the first withdrawal, and the next attempt met the same row and threw in
 * the same place. A person with three grants and one unreadable row could not withdraw any of them,
 * ever, while being told to try again. That replaced a false success with a permanent block, which
 * is the same defect pointing the other way.
 *
 * WHAT A PERSON IS OWED IS BOTH HALVES: every grant this deployment CAN name withdrawn, and a
 * sentence counting the ones it cannot. The second half is not a thing they can retry — the row
 * will be unreadable next time too — so the refusal names the dashboard rather than the button
 * they just pressed.
 *
 * A ROW THAT IS NOT AN OBJECT IS NOT A CASE HERE, and that is the SDK's doing rather than an
 * omission. `transformConnectedAccountResponse` reads `response.auth_config.id` while building
 * every row (`@composio/core` 0.18.1, `src/utils/transformers/connectedAccounts.ts:60`), so a
 * non-object row raises a `TypeError` inside the vendor's own code and never reaches this function
 * — see the `TypeError` row in {@link vendorRefusal}, which is where that answer is now given.
 *
 * ONE ID IS ONE WITHDRAWAL, HOWEVER MANY TIMES THE LISTING NAMED IT. The paging loop above guards
 * against a vendor repeating a CURSOR and not against it repeating a ROW, and those are different
 * faults: a page boundary crossed while an account is created or deleted, or a proxy stitching two
 * overlapping pages together, hands the same account id over twice with a cursor that advanced
 * normally every time. The second delete of one account then meets Composio's "there is no such
 * account", which arrives here as a refusal — so {@link ComposioBroker.revoke} counted a
 * withdrawal that had in fact completed as a partial one, threw over it, and left the person's
 * connection row standing to be pressed again. Every retry meets the same duplicate. Deduplicating
 * is not tidying the listing: it is the difference between one account and two.
 *
 * THE FIRST SIGHTING KEEPS ITS PLACE, so the order the deletes go out in is still the listing's,
 * which is the order {@link buildComposioClient}'s sort makes stable.

 * Composio's own verdict on one withdrawal, as a refusal wherever it is not a yes.
 *
 * THE VENDOR TELLS US WHEN THE DELETE DID NOT HAPPEN AND NOTHING WAS LOOKING. `success` is a
 * required field of `ConnectedAccountDeleteResponse` — see the declaration on
 * {@link ComposioVendor}'s `connectedAccounts.delete` — and the answer used to be thrown away
 * unread. A 200 whose body says `success: false` therefore became a withdrawn account in
 * {@link ComposioBroker.revoke}'s count, a `true` out of that method, and a
 * `vendorRevocationRequested: true` in the audit trail, over a grant Composio had just said it had
 * not touched. That is the same class of lie as the unflagged delete before it and the one-page
 * listing before that, arriving through the one door left unwatched: the reply.
 *
 * WHICH DOES NOT BLUR "ASKED" INTO "DONE", and the distinction is worth being exact about because
 * the whole audit field rests on it. `success: true` still claims no more than it ever did — the
 * account is gone at the broker and the revocation job was started — and whether Google honoured it
 * happens afterwards, out of sight, with no supported way to poll. What `success: false` adds is
 * the other end: Composio did not delete the account, so there is no job and nothing was asked of
 * the provider at all. Reading it narrows the set of things `true` can be covering up rather than
 * widening what `true` means.
 *
 * TWO SENTENCES, BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT FACTS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. "Composio said
 * no" is a fact about this account: the account is still there, a second press reaches it, and the
 * caller's own count already says to press again. "Composio answered with something where its
 * verdict belongs" is a fact about the package — nobody holding an admin page can correct the shape
 * of a reply, and pressing disconnect again would be answered identically — so it carries
 * {@link VENDOR_SHAPE_REMEDY} instead. Collapsing the two would send an operator to press a button
 * for a condition no button changes.
 *
 * NULLABLE IN THE PARAMETER THOUGH THE DECLARATION SAYS OTHERWISE. The generated client parses the
 * body and returns it, and there are two answers for which it hands over no body at all.
 *
 * AND NO BODY AT ALL IS NOT A REFUSAL, WHICH IS THE CORRECTION AND THE OPPOSITE MISTAKE TO THE ONE
 * ABOVE. `defaultParseResponse` resolves a 204 to `null` — "fetch refuses to read the body when the
 * status code is 204" — and a JSON reply carrying `content-length: 0` to `undefined`
 * (`@composio/client` 0.1.0-alpha.76, `src/internal/parse.ts:16-42`). Neither of those ever reaches
 * a non-2xx: the client throws `APIError` for every `!response.ok` before parsing
 * (`src/client.ts:539`), so an answer arriving here at all is Composio having accepted the request.
 * A 204 is therefore the vendor saying it did the delete and has nothing to add, and the guard
 * added for `success: false` read it as the one shape it could not tell apart from a failure —
 * turning a withdrawal that HAPPENED into a partial-withdrawal refusal, over a grant that was in
 * fact ended. That is the same lie as the one this function exists to stop, pointing the other way.
 *
 * WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS A BODY THAT ARRIVED WITHOUT THE FIELD. `{}` is Composio answering with a
 * document whose verdict is missing, and a document this deployment cannot read is a fact about the
 * package rather than an outcome — so it stays in the unreadable branch below. What is exempted
 * here is the narrower thing the client documents: no document.
 *
 * AND A BODY THAT IS NOT A DOCUMENT IS A THIRD THING AGAIN, WHICH THE LAST BRANCH USED TO SPEAK FOR.
 * The same parse that hands over `{}` hands over whatever else the body held, so a reply that is a
 * bare string or a list reaches this read too — and `("deleted").success` is `undefined`, not a
 * throw. The refusal then said "Composio sent nothing where its verdict belongs, and that field is
 * the only thing in the reply that says whether the account was deleted": a claim about a reply with
 * one field missing, made about an answer that was not a reply. The shape is the whole finding, and
 * it was the one part the sentence did not name. The parameter widens to `unknown` for the same
 * reason — a declaration naming `{ success?: unknown }` over a wire value is the assertion this file

 * so the listing reads `client.tools.list` and {@link VendorToolRow} is the wire's own shape. Five
 * refusals once stood here for five shapes that parse caught — a description that is a number, an
 * input schema that is a string of JSON, tags that are not all labels, a version that is a number,
 * and a row that is not an object at all — and each was deleted as unreachable. Four of the five
 * had already come back, on the argument below. The fifth, the container, comes back with this
 * change, because there is nothing at all between Composio and this function now.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT THAT BROUGHT THE OTHER FOUR BACK IS THE SAME MISTAKE AS THE DELETED CATEGORY GUARD
 * IN {@link appOf}, CORRECTED THE SAME WAY. "The SDK validates this" is a fact about one method of
 * one version, and it is not a fact about {@link ComposioVendor}, which is the seam this function
 * actually sits on and the shape a test satisfies with a literal. Running it settles what the
 * difference costs: a `description` of 42 and an input schema of "not-a-schema" both travel through
 * here untouched into {@link ComposioAction}, whose declared types say they cannot. What they reach
 * is not a refusal. `storableTools` writes
 * `(tool.description ?? "").replaceAll(NUL, "")` and `tool.version?.replaceAll(NUL, "")`
 * (`./store`), so a description or a version that is not a string is a bare
 * "42.replaceAll is not a function" thrown from outside every vendor `try` in this file — a crash
 * wearing a refusal's clothes, which is the one outcome none of this file's sentences may become.
 * An `inputParameters` that is not an object is quieter and worse: it is stored as the app's input
 * schema and then shown to a model as Composio's own.
 *
 * SO THE THREE WIRE VALUES THIS FILE HANDS ON ARE CHECKED HERE, BESIDE THE SLUG, and `tags` is not
 * — `./composio` already refuses a `tags` that is not a list where it reads them, and a check on
 * both sides of one seam is a check nobody maintains.
 *
 * WHAT THE SCHEMA DOES NOT SETTLE IS THE FOURTH. `slug: z.string()` is satisfied by the
 * empty string, and an action's slug is not a label: it becomes `mcp_tools.name`, which is NOT NULL
 * and half that table's primary key, it is what a grant points at, and it is what a later call
 * sends back to Composio. An empty one is a row that cannot be written and a call that names
 * nothing, so it is refused here.
 *
 * A PLAIN `Error` RATHER THAN A `BrokerRefusalError`, because this listing's failures are not
 * answered to a route. `./composio` records them in an app's `lastError` for an administrator to
 * read on its Plugins page, and `listingSentence` passes an authored message through untouched.

 * connection to gmail was not begun" is what this deployment did about it, and a reader needs both
 * — the first to know why asking again will not help, the second to know what state they are in
 * now. The vendor cannot supply the second, because it does not know which of this file's ten calls
 * it was answering.
 *
 * WRITTEN AT THE CALL SITE AS A FINISHED CLAUSE, in the past tense, so that it reads after "so"
 * without any sentence below having to conjugate it. That is also what keeps the outcomes honest:
 * each one is composed beside the call it describes, where whether anything was sent is a fact
 * rather than a guess.

 * `name` (`src/errors/*.ts`), so the name is the vendor's published discriminator and is stable
 * across the package boundary; `instanceof` is not, because it is identity on a constructor and
 * therefore hostage to a second copy of the package anywhere in the tree. The SDK makes the same
 * judgement about its own classes — `isRequestAbortError` falls back to `constructor.name` and
 * `name` and says why: "dual-package-hazard cases" (`src/errors/SDKErrors.ts`). `./composio`'s
 * `isSchemaMismatch` reaches for a shape rather than a class for the same reason.

 * Composio said nothing about why and that an administrator should check this deployment's Composio
 * key. That is exactly right about a socket that hung up. It is wrong twice over about a condition
 * `@composio/core` raised by name: the key is fine — the call that failed usually went out through
 * a listing that had just succeeded on the same key — and several of these states are settled at
 * the vendor, so the "and try again" half of the advice is an instruction to repeat something that
 * will answer identically for ever. The worst of them is the first row below: a person who already
 * has an account for an app was told to check an API key and retry.
 *
 * ONE SENTENCE PER CONDITION AND NO SENTENCE SHARED, which is the property its test asserts in both
 * directions. A translation that gave two conditions one wording would be worse than leaving both
 * alone: the reader would be handed a remedy that is right for somebody else's failure and would
 * have no way to tell, where an untranslated failure at least says plainly that nothing is known.
 *
 * NULL WHERE COMPOSIO'S OWN SERVER EXPLAINED ITSELF, WHICH IS THE LIMIT ON DOING THIS AT ALL.
 * `routes.ts` reads `brokerSentence` first and `vendorSentence` second, so a refusal authored here
 * HIDES the vendor's message rather than joining it. Several of the SDK's classes are wrappers
 * around whatever the API returned — `ComposioFailedToCreateConnectedAccountLink` keeps the
 * `BadRequestError` as its `cause` (`src/models/ConnectedAccounts.ts`), and `vendorSentence` reaches
 * through exactly that nesting — so translating one of those unconditionally would replace a
 * specific server sentence with this deployment's general one. Where the vendor said something a
 * reader can use, the error goes on untouched and the vendor gets the last word.
 *
 * THE ORIGINAL IS KEPT AS `cause` on every refusal, for whoever is reading a log rather than a page.
 * It is never quoted into the message: the file's promise about {@link BrokerRefusalError} is that
 * its sentence is safe to show anybody who could have made the request, and a vendor error object
 * out of `connectedAccounts.link` carries the request that was being minted.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, because the route's default answer is the correct one for it:
 * `ComposioToolkitFetchError`, which `Toolkits.getToolkits` wraps around EVERY catalogue failure
 * including its own validation one, and whose message is the bare "Failed to fetch toolkits" — the
 * key and the status page genuinely are the remedy; and `ComposioToolExecutionError`, the same
 * wrapper one call further on, whose `cause` carries the server's own words for `vendorSentence` to
 * find and whose own message `./composio`'s {@link VENDOR_PLACEHOLDER} already refuses to pass on.

 * What this adapter needs of `@composio/core`'s client, written as a shape rather than as a class.
 *
 * A TEST SATISFIES IT WITH AN OBJECT LITERAL, which is the entire argument for it and the reason
 * {@link buildComposioClient} takes one of these instead of an API key. The vendor's own client
 * cannot be constructed without a key and answers nothing without a network, so an adapter that
 * built its own client would be an adapter no test could reach — and this is the file where the
 * field names, the argument order and the refusal below would go wrong unnoticed.
 *
 * Every member is written with METHOD syntax deliberately. Method parameters are compared
 * bivariantly, so a real `Composio` — whose signatures carry optional request-options arguments
 * and wider parameter types than the calls here use — satisfies this without a cast.
 *
 * THE TWO DELETES ARE NOT `Composio`'s, AND THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THIS SHAPE DIVERGES FROM IT. Both
 * of the vendor's own wrappers hard-code the request body they send — `this.client.authConfigs
 * .delete(nanoid, undefined, requestOptions)` and the same line for connected accounts
 * (`@composio/core` 0.18.1, `src/models/AuthConfigs.ts:303-311` and
 * `src/models/ConnectedAccounts.ts:532-540`) — so through them the `revoke_on_delete` parameter
 * cannot be passed at all, and both calls soft-delete while the grant at Google or Slack stands. So
 * the shape below asks for the underlying client's signature instead, and
 * {@link createComposioClient} satisfies it from `composio.getClient()`. See
 * {@link ComposioBroker.revoke} for what that flag is and what its absence made this deployment
 * claim.

     * WHAT THE WRAPPER WAS DOING THAT THIS HAS TO KEEP DOING IS TWO PARAMETERS AND ONE NO-OP.
     * `toolkit_versions` is the SDK's own `toolkitVersions` config, which defaults to "latest"
     * (`src/utils/config-defaults/ConfigDefaults.node.ts`) and was forwarded on every listing it
     * made (`src/models/Tools.ts:548`); it decides which `version` each action comes back with,
     * which is the value a later call sends back to Composio, so it is passed here as the literal
     * the default is. `important` is the one this file already knew about and is now simply not
     * named: the wrapper set it to "true" whenever a toolkit query carried no limit (`:505-515`),
     * which NARROWS the answer to a featured subset that nothing in the answer declares. And the
     * no-op is `applyDefaultSchemaModifiers`, which returns its argument untouched unless
     * `dangerouslyAllowAutoUploadDownloadFiles` is on (`:242-248`); it defaults off
     * (`ConfigDefaults.node.ts`) and {@link createComposioClient} does not turn it on — which is
     * the premise `./composio`'s file-upload guard is written on.
     *
     * AND `ToolSchema.parse` IS GONE WITH IT, WHICH IS A GAIN AND A COST, BOTH WRITTEN DOWN
     * ELSEWHERE. The gain is that the parse STRIPPED every schema key its `ParametersSchema` did
     * not name before any caller could see it — see {@link ComposioAction.inputParameters}, where
     * that loss was recorded as unavoidable and where the fix was named as this exact call. The

     * to travel on that call. `initiate` does carry one (`:249`), but the endpoint under it is
     * retired for Composio-managed OAuth on redirectable schemes — cutover 2026-05-08 for new

     * creates. `link` is the vendor's own named replacement for that combination, carries the
     * callback, and answers in the same shape.
     *
     * TAKING THE AUTH CONFIG ID IS NOT A COST HERE. It is the one thing `toolkits.authorize` was
     * doing for us, and it did it by listing the configs and creating one at Composio's managed
     * defaults where it found none — which this deployment already does for itself, at enable
     * time, named so an operator can find it in their dashboard. The listing below is that same

     * being offboarded — runs through here, so an unflagged delete made all three of those claims
     * false at once and wrote `true` into the audit trail beside them.
     *
     * WHAT THE FLAG BUYS IS A REQUEST AND NOT A RESULT, which is the whole reason
     * {@link ComposioBroker.revoke}'s answer is named the way it is. The upstream revocation runs as

     * generally available endpoint polls it (`:7447-7459`). Nothing here can say the provider tore
     * the refresh token up, and nothing here pretends to.
     *
     * BUT THE ANSWER DOES SAY WHETHER COMPOSIO DID ITS OWN HALF, AND THAT WAS BEING DISCARDED.
     * `ConnectedAccountDeleteResponse` carries a REQUIRED `success: boolean`, "indicates whether
     * the connected account was successfully deleted" (`@composio/client` 0.1.0-alpha.76,
     * `resources/connected-accounts.d.ts:7445-7459`). This used to be `Promise<unknown>`, read for
     * nothing, on the argument that no field on the answer could support a stronger claim than "we
     * asked". That argument is true of the REVOCATION and false of the DELETE: a 200 carrying
     * `success: false` is Composio saying it did not delete the account, so the background job the
     * flag asks for was never started either — and {@link ComposioBroker.revoke} answered `true`
     * over the top of it while the grant stood at the provider. Reading it is not a stronger claim
     * than "we asked"; it is the difference between having asked and having been refused.
     *
     * DECLARED `success?: unknown` RATHER THAN AT THE VENDOR'S OWN `boolean`, for the reason every
     * other field in this projection is: the generated client parses the body and hands it over, so
     * "required" is the schema's promise about what Composio means to send rather than a fact about
     * what arrived. {@link withdrawalDeclined} is where the three answers are told apart.
     *
     * `revoke_job_id` IS DELIBERATELY NOT READ, and its absence is deliberately not a refusal. The
     * same declaration marks it optional and says it is present "only when `revoke_on_delete=true`"
     * — which says when it CAN appear, not that it always does — so a guard on it would turn every
     * withdrawal Composio accepted into a permanent failure the first time they stopped sending it,
     * which is the shape of mistake this file has already made twice in the other direction.
     *
     * NULLABLE AND OPTIONAL THOUGH THE VENDOR'S OWN DECLARATION IS NEITHER, because the generated
     * client has two answers it resolves with no document: a 204 becomes `null` and a JSON reply
     * carrying `content-length: 0` becomes `undefined` (`@composio/client` 0.1.0-alpha.76,
     * `src/internal/parse.ts:16-42`). Declaring this at the vendor's `ConnectedAccountDeleteResponse`

   * Ask for every one of them and answer with what refused, rather than stopping at the first.
   *
   * A THROW MID-LOOP ABANDONS GRANTS THAT ARE STILL LIVE. Both callers below are deleting a set of
   * things that each independently hold somebody's access, and an exception out of the second of
   * five leaves three untouched and unmentioned — while the caller is told only about the one that
   * failed, so nothing in the answer says the loop did not finish. Attempting all of them makes the
   * failure a statement about a set: this many were asked for and this many refused.
   *
   * SERIALLY RATHER THAN TOGETHER, for the same reason every other call here goes out one at a
   * time: the vendor rate-limits, and a person with several accounts is not a reason to open
   * several connections. The order is the listing's, which is sorted.
   *
   * EVERY REFUSAL IS ANSWERED AND NOT ONLY THE FIRST. What the callers do with this list is throw a
   * COUNT — "two of three were withdrawn and the rest refused" — because a count is what a reader
   * can act on, which makes the reasons the only place the detail lives. Returning them all is what
   * lets {@link everyRefusal} put all of them on the failure the caller raises; the previous version
   * collected them and both callers then read `refused[0]`, so the second and third reason existed
   * for the length of one expression and were then dropped.
   *
   * EVERY FAILURE IS A REFUSAL HERE, AND THE CLASSIFICATION THAT USED TO SIT IN THIS LOOP HAS MOVED
   * ONE LAYER DOWN. There was an `isOurFault` test in the catch that re-threw a `TypeError`, a
   * `ReferenceError` or a `RangeError` rather than counting it, on the premise that those are what
   * a program's own mistake looks like and are never "a thing Composio can reply". The premise is
   * false — see the `TypeError` row in {@link vendorRefusal} for the five vendor shapes that raise
   * exactly that from inside `@composio/core`'s own transformers — so its effect was inverted: a
   * vendor fault escaped the loop as a bug of ours, abandoning every account after it unasked, and
   * the person was handed a crash instead of a sentence.
   *
   * IT MOVED RATHER THAN BEING RETUNED because this loop cannot make the distinction and
   * {@link askVendor} can. Every `ask` below is one `await vendor.*` wrapped by that function, so
   * whether a fault came from inside the vendor's code is a fact about the call stack there, where
   * here it could only ever have been guessed at from an error class.

       * had no config at all. A config an operator made by hand, meanwhile, satisfied the check and

       * see, and delete it when the app is removed. A config of our own, named, is the thing every
       * decision in this file can actually reason about.

       * withdrawal — and what it starts is a background job the vendor gives no supported way to
       * poll. So the account is gone at the broker by the time this returns and nothing here can
       * call with it again; whether Google has torn up the refresh token happens afterwards. `true`
       * claims exactly that much. See {@link ComposioVendor} for the two declarations this rests on.

       * deployment's calls could run under. See {@link REVOCABLE} for why the listing here is wider
       * than the one behind `isConnected`.
       *
       * AND EVERY ACCOUNT MEANS EVERY ACCOUNT ON A CONFIG THIS DEPLOYMENT MADE, WHICH IS NARROWER
       * THAN WHAT THIS USED TO DELETE. The listing was asked by person, app and "all account
       * types" and by nothing else, so it returned accounts attached to authorization configs an
       * operator built by hand in Composio's dashboard — for purposes this deployment knows nothing
       * about, on scopes it cannot see, and, with `accountType: "ALL"`, including the SHARED ones
       * that other people are acting through. Every one of those was then deleted with
       * `revoke_on_delete`, which tears the grant up at Google or Slack. One person pressing
       * disconnect on their own settings page ended somebody else's integration.
       *
       * WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE {@link ComposioBroker.deleteAuthConfig} ALREADY STATES, ARRIVING
       * ONE LEVEL DOWN. That method refuses to delete a config it cannot show is this
       * deployment's, on the reasoning that an operator's dashboard work is not ours to destroy —
       * and the accounts hanging off that config are the same work. {@link madeHere} is the only
       * thing that tells the two apart, so it decides both.
       *
       * NOTHING AT ALL IS NOTHING TO WITHDRAW, AND IT IS ANSWERED WITHOUT ASKING. An app Composio
       * holds no configs for never had a connection begun through it — {@link
       * ComposioBroker.authorize} mints every link against a config of this deployment's and
       * refuses where there is none — so there is nothing here that this deployment granted.
       * Answering before the listing is also what keeps the empty filter off the wire; see
       * `authConfigIds` on {@link ComposioVendor} for why an empty one must never be sent.
       *
       * BUT "NOTHING OF OURS" IS NOT THAT STATE, AND ANSWERING `false` TO IT WAS THE SEVENTH ROUTE
       * TO A REVOCATION THAT DID NOT REVOKE. The reasoning above is sound about an app with no
       * configs and cannot tell that app from this one: an operator renames a config in Composio's
       * dashboard — drops the suffix, or edits the app's title past it — and this deployment's own
       * live grants read as somebody else's work. `false` then means "there was nothing to
       * withdraw", `store.ts` writes `vendorRevocationRequested: false` into the audit trail and
       * deletes the `composio_connections` row, and the person's grant stands at Google with
       * nothing in this deployment naming it. The trail records that no withdrawal was even asked
       * for, which is the one direction nobody thinks to check.
       *
       * {@link ComposioBroker.deleteAuthConfig} REFUSES IN EXACTLY THIS STATE, and two halves of
       * one operation cannot disagree about one condition. Its reading is the right one and this is
       * the half that moves: the app's configs are legible, none of them carries the suffix, and
       * nothing in the row says whether that is an operator's own work or ours under a title
       * somebody edited. A refusal leaves the connection row standing, which is what keeps the
       * person's grant findable, and names the same one act in a dashboard that the removal does.
       *

         * account it described with no id is not: the row will be as unnameable next time, so the
         * only honest instruction is the one that does not run through this page at all.
         *
         * WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE TWO INDEPENDENT CLAUSES AND NOT A CHAIN. They were an `if`/`else
         * if`, so one person holding both kinds — a nameless row beside a refused one, which is one
         * listing away from either on its own — was told only that "disconnecting again meets them
         * unchanged". That sentence is true of the row with no id and false of the refused account
         * sitting next to it, and it is the sentence deciding whether they press the button again:
         * the one remedy that would actually have ended the refused grant was withheld by the
         * presence of a row it says nothing about. Two facts about two different accounts cannot
         * take turns. {@link ComposioBroker.deleteAuthConfig} writes the identical pair as two
         * independent `if`s one method up, and the paragraph above already described these as two
         * remedies — the chain was the only thing disagreeing.
         *
         * THE REACHABLE REMEDY GOES FIRST, matching that method's order, because it is the one the

         * many rows the listing handed over, and a listing that named one account twice is a
         * listing with more rows than accounts — see {@link withdrawableAccounts}. "Withdrew 1 of
         * this person's 2 accounts" over one account that is gone is a count nothing measured, in

     * thing about a real app. Every step of this read used to answer it for a shape it could not
     * make sense of as well — a `fields` that is not an object, an initiation block that arrived as
     * the rows that used to sit inside it, a `required` that stopped being a list — so an app that
     * asks for nothing and an answer nothing here can open were the same empty form in the browser,
     * and the argument two paragraphs down for why that form must never be drawn applied to both.
     *
     * AND A SCHEME THIS APP NO LONGER PUBLISHES IS A THIRD ANSWER AGAIN, WITH A REMEDY OF ITS OWN.
     * The scheme is the RECORDED one and is never re-derived — that is the whole point of the
     * column, and the store's own column comment says so — so "Composio does not publish this mode
     * for this app" is exactly the drift between the row and the vendor that recording it
     * anticipates, and it used to surface as a form with no boxes in it. A person presses submit
     * on that form, {@link ComposioBroker.connectWithFields} creates a connection
     * carrying no credential at all, Composio answers `ACTIVE` because it does not grade what it is
     * given, and the first call made with the account is what discovers anything is wrong. An empty
     * form is also, from the person's end, a box they cannot fill in. So the two states are told
     * apart here: no such mode refuses and names the recorded one — an administrator's remedy,
     * because the recorded scheme is only theirs to rewrite — while a mode that exists and
     * publishes nothing visible still answers `[]`, and a mode whose published shape cannot be read
     * refuses with the upgrade that is the only thing which fixes a vendor changing shape.
     *
     * REQUIRED AND OPTIONAL IN THAT ORDER, because the order is what a person reads down. The
     * vendor publishes them as two lists and the required ones are the ones that stop the form; a
     * form that interleaved them, or put the optional base-url box above the key, would be asking

     * The rule the module comment states and every other path keeps is that a vendor error is never
     * logged and always carried as `cause`, precisely because the object holds the request it was
     * made for and whoever is reading a log rather than a page deserves it. On every other call
     * that request is a link mint or a delete. On this one it is somebody's API key: the body below
     * carries the value they pasted into the form, and an `APIError` out of a create carries the
     * body. So the catch reads the vendor's sentence through the one door {@link vendorSentence}
     * owns and then drops the object entirely — not attached, not rethrown, nothing left for a
     * handler further out to serialize.
     *
     * WHAT THAT COSTS IS THE DIAGNOSTIC TRAIL ON THE FLOW PEOPLE MOST OFTEN MISTYPE, AND THE COST IS
     * ACCEPTED KNOWINGLY. A key pasted with a newline, a token from the wrong workspace, a secret
     * for the staging tenant — these are the ordinary failures here, and this leaves nothing behind
     * about any of them. What an operator gets instead is Composio's own sentence and the request
     * id inside it, which is what Composio's dashboard searches on: enough to ask the vendor about
     * that attempt, and not enough to rebuild it here. A `cause` that made the next mistyped key
     * easier to explain would put every correctly typed one in a log for as long as the log is kept.
     *
     * NOT {@link askVendor}, WHICH IS THE SAME DECISION SEEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. That function is
     * what every other vendor call in this file goes through, and every refusal it builds attaches
     * the original — see {@link vendorRefusal}, where the `cause` is the point. Routing this call
     * through it would be the rule applying here by default, which is the one place it must not.
     *
     * NO VERIFICATION HERE, AND THE ABSENCE IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. Composio does not grade a submitted
     * key: a connection created with an obviously wrong value comes back `ACTIVE`. Whether the
     * credential works is settled by making a call with it, which is why this answers the

     * OF ITS OWN. Without the flag the account stops being visible to this deployment and the

     * no revocation was started and nothing was asked of the provider — the same lie
     * {@link withdrawalDeclined} exists to stop one method away. It matters MORE here than there,
     * because of what this call's caller does with a clean return. The verification step withdraws
     * the account behind a key that failed, and where the withdrawal ITSELF fails it writes the row
     * unverified so the account stays reachable and disconnectable. A `success: false` resolving
     * normally takes the other branch: no row is written, and what is left standing is a live
     * account holding a working-or-not credential that nothing on any screen names and nobody can
     * press disconnect on.
     *
     * ITS OWN SENTENCES RATHER THAN {@link withdrawalDeclined}'s, because that function's two are

/**
 * The lines that turn this deployment's API key into a vendor client.
 *
 * Most of what this file decides lives in {@link buildComposioClient}, and this one used to say it
 * therefore had "no decision worth testing". That sentence was wrong twice over and both times in
 * the same way: this is where the SDK's DEFAULTS are accepted or refused, and a default accepted by
 * omission looks exactly like a default nobody thought about. It cost the two deletes their
 * `revoke_on_delete` once — see the describe about which delete the vendor carries — and it left
 * the construction literal below unpinned, so that deleting a line from it phoned out on boot and
 * broke no test. Both are now asserted; the construction literal carries its own note.
 *
 * The key is a parameter here and a private field of the vendor's client thereafter, and no path
 * out of this module carries it — see the module comment. That is also why this returns the seam
 * rather than the vendor: handing `composio` back would put the key on an object any caller could
 * read, so the construction below is asserted by what it DOES, not by a config object a test could
 * inspect.
 *
 * IT IS NO LONGER ONE LINE, AND THE REASON WAS THE TWO DELETES AND IS NOW ALSO THE TWO LISTINGS.
 * `Composio` used to satisfy {@link ComposioVendor} whole, passed straight in. It cannot any more,
 * for two separate faults in the same wrapper. Its own `authConfigs.delete` and
 * `connectedAccounts.delete` send a hard-coded empty body and therefore cannot ask for the upstream
 * revocation, which is the difference between ending somebody's access and filing it away. And its
 * `tools.getRawComposioTools` and `toolkits.get` cannot be paged — one takes no cursor, the other
 * drops the response's — which is the difference between a catalogue and the first thousand rows
 * of one, and which showed an operator an empty app picker. The underlying `@composio/client`
 * answers all four, so those members are satisfied from `getClient()` and the rest from the SDK's
 * own models. A wrapper per member rather than a spread, so that the arrow's own type checks
 * against the shape above — a vendor method whose signature drifted would fail here rather than at
 * the call site.
 *
 * NO NEW IMPORT, WHICH IS WHY THE ONE-IMPORT-SITE RULE SURVIVES THIS. `getClient()` is public on the
 * SDK's own object and the client's types are inferred from it; `@composio/client` is not named
 * anywhere under `server/src`, so a version bump still has exactly this file to be read against.
