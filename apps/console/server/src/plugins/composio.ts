 * The Composio transport: an app somebody enabled, reached as the person asking.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER TRANSPORTS. `mcp` dials somebody else's server and
 * `google-drive-rest` dials Google; both answer to a credential, and whose it is was settled before
 * the connection was built. `builtin-routines` has no credential at all. This one has a credential
 * that is not the answer: the deployment holds ONE Composio key, and which person's Gmail it opens is
 * decided by a user id we send alongside it. So the ACTOR is the authorization here, exactly as it is
 * for Routines, and for the same reason {@link callTool} refuses a run that is not attributed to
 * anybody.
 *
 * THE USER ID IS NEVER AN ARGUMENT. It comes off the connection, which the call path derives from the
 * session. A model that could name a user id could open somebody else's mailbox, and that is not
 * hypothetical: it is the defect OpenTag shipped and fixed three separate times. Nothing below reads
 * `args` looking for an identity, which is what makes it structurally impossible rather than merely
 * checked.
 *
 * It implements the same interface as the other three, as module-level exports, because that is the
 * shape {@link ./transport} resolves: a `TransportKind` maps to a MODULE. Which is also why the client
 * arrives through a setter rather than a constructor — the registry is built at import time, long
 * before anything has read configuration. {@link useComposioClient} is that setter.
 *
 * `index.ts` CALLS IT AT STARTUP, from the one place that holds the key: it builds the client
 * through `./composio-adapter` where `config.composioApiKey` is set and installs the actions seam
 * with it. So on a deployment that has a key `installed` is a real client, and every mention of
 * "the client" below describes wiring that runs. A deployment with no key installs nothing and
 * leaves it null, which is a state this module is written for rather than an outage —
 * {@link listTools} throws a sentence saying so and {@link callTool} refuses with one.

 * here to be read. See {@link listTools} for what is done with the answer.
 *
 * WALKED, NOT LOOKED UP. Composio toolkits routinely put the flag behind a `$ref`/`$defs`
 * indirection or inside an `anyOf` variant, which is why the vendor's own predicate recurses
 * through both (`src/utils/modifiers/FileToolModifier.utils.neutral.ts:77-134`). A check that read
 * only the top level of `properties` would answer false for every ref-based schema, which is the
 * majority of the ones that carry a file.
 *
 * WHAT BOUNDS THE LIST IS WHAT THE WIRE CAN CARRY, AND THAT IS NO LONGER WHAT THE SDK KEPT. This
 * comment bounded the list by a strip: a keyword `ParametersSchema` and `JSONSchemaPropertySchema`
 * did not name could not be present to be walked, because `ToolSchema.parse` removed it before any
 * caller saw the schema, so nothing outside those two zod objects needed a branch. That premise
 * belonged to the WRAPPER and the wrapper is gone. `./composio-adapter` reads `client.tools.list`
 * and runs no parse over the answer — it had to, because `getRawComposioTools` is the one method of
 * the vendor's tool model that cannot be paged — so what arrives here is the schema Composio
 * published, whole, which is what {@link ComposioAction.inputParameters} above now promises.
 *
 * SO THE APPLICATORS THE STRIP USED TO REMOVE ARE WALKED, because every one of them is now a place
 * a toolkit can hide a file. `prefixItems`, `contains`, `dependentSchemas`, `propertyNames`,
 * `unevaluatedItems` and `unevaluatedProperties` are 2020-12 applicators and `dependencies` is
 * draft-07's, and none of the seven appears in either zod object. Each was unreachable while the
 * parse stood and reachable the moment it went, and an unwalked one is an action offered to a model
 * under both auto-upload settings whose every call fails at the vendor's staging lookup — the same
 * defect `additionalProperties` was, arriving through six more doors.
 *
 * SEVERAL OF THESE ARE UNIONS RATHER THAN PLAIN SUBSCHEMAS, and no arm needs a case of its own.
 * `additionalProperties`, `unevaluatedItems` and `unevaluatedProperties` union with `boolean`;
 * `items` unions with a tuple array; `dependencies` maps a name to a subschema OR to a list of
 * required property names. The boolean and the string list fall out of {@link schemaNode}, which
 * answers null for both, and the tuple arm is what the second loop's `Array.isArray` is for.
 *
 * Wider than the vendor's predicate by `patternProperties`, `not`, the conditional trio and the
 * seven above, which that one skips: a file staged only under a condition is still a file this
 * deployment cannot stage.
 *
 * AND IT ANSWERS THREE THINGS RATHER THAN TWO, WHICH IS THE GUARD EVERY OTHER READ OF THIS LISTING
 * ALREADY HAD. This returned a boolean, so every shape it could not make sense of came back as "no
 * file here" and the action was offered — the one direction this filter must not fail in. Two
 * shapes reach that: a `file_uploadable` that is not a flag, and a schema nested deeper than
 * {@link SCHEMA_DEPTH}, which this walked as far as the vendor cared to nest it. The second is the
 * worse of the two, because the walk sits OUTSIDE the try that wraps the vendor's call: a schema
 * deep enough to exhaust the stack left through the one door in this function with nothing standing
 * in it, as `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`, which is the string `refreshTools`
 * writes into the app row's `lastError` for an administrator to read. That sentence names neither
 * the app nor the action, and the engine is not a party anybody can act on. The third answer is a

 * Whether an action published under this schema would be refused if it were called with no arguments.
 *
 * WHO ASKS, AND WHAT A WRONG ANSWER COSTS. `probeActionFor` in `store.ts` picks the read action a
 * key check is spent on, and that check is called with an EMPTY argument object. An action that
 * turns out to need an argument answers with the vendor's validation error, which arrives as
 * "Composio ran it and it failed" — indistinguishable at that layer from "the vendor rejected this
 * key". On the connect path that deletes the account created seconds earlier and tells the person
 * what they typed was wrong; on the re-check path it stamps a working connection with the named
 * probe beside `verified: false`, which is the one state the settings page tells an operator to act
 * on. So a false NO here manufactures an accusation against a valid credential.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY IT FAILS CLOSED, and that is the reverse of what the caller used to do. The filter
 * read `schema.required` at the top level only and its comment reasoned that anything which is not
 * a non-empty list is "no reason to pass this action over" — fail-open in exactly the direction that
 * costs an accusation. A required list published under `allOf`/`anyOf`/`oneOf`, or behind a `$ref`,
 * is the ordinary way a generated toolkit writes one, and every such action passed that filter. The
 * sibling walker {@link stagesAFile} already descends these keywords over these very schemas, on
 * the stated grounds that inspecting only the top level "would answer false for every ref-based
 * schema". A YES costs one candidate out of a list; the fallback is the next safe read, and where
 * there is none the app is simply not checkable, which the page already draws.
 *
 * ONLY THE KEYWORDS THAT BEAR ON AN EMPTY OBJECT ARE WALKED, which is narrower than that sibling
 * and deliberately so. `required` inside `properties`, `patternProperties`, `items`, `$defs`,
 * `dependentSchemas` or draft-07 `dependencies` applies only once something is present, and `{}`
 * presents nothing — descending them would refuse nearly every action over a constraint the call
 * can never trip. What is left is the composition trio, the conditional trio, and the two shapes
 * that cannot be reasoned about at all: a `$ref`, which needs a resolver this deployment does not
 * have, and a `not`, whose arms invert. Both answer YES rather than being walked.
 *
 * AND `anyOf`/`oneOf` ARE TREATED AS `allOf` HERE. Strictly, one satisfiable arm is enough, so an
 * arm with no `required` would make `{}` legal. Deciding that needs the whole arm evaluated rather
 * than its `required` read, and being wrong about it costs the accusation above — so any arm that
 * asks is taken as the action asking.
 *
 * An ABSENT schema is not an unreadable one and answers NO: most of the catalogue's identity reads
 * publish nothing, and a vendor that stated no requirement has stated none. A schema that is present
 * and is not an object is unreadable and answers YES.

/**
 * Every action this app publishes, in the shape a `tools/list` answer has, plus what we know about it.
 *
 * An action with no schema is still listed, with an open one. The vendor is the right party to reject a
 * bad argument, and an action silently missing from the list reads to an administrator as an app that
 * does not have it. The one exception is an action that asks for a FILE, which is dropped — see the
 * criterion beside the filter below, and note that it turns on the action being uncallable rather
 * than on its schema being unfamiliar.
 *
 * A listing that could not be read at all is a THROW rather than an empty list, for the same reason
 * turned around: an empty list is what an app with no actions looks like, so answering emptily would
 * report a success and strand every grant. What throws is a sentence, never a vendor object. See the
 * catch below.
 *
 * AND SO IS A LISTING NOBODY WAS ASKED FOR, which is the same criterion applied one step earlier.
 * `[]` from a `listTools` means, in `mcp.ts`, `google-drive-rest.ts` and `builtin-routines.ts`
 * alike, "the vendor was asked and advertises no actions" — and `refreshTools` commits that as a
 * healthy refresh. This function used to answer `[]` for a url naming no app and for a deployment
 * with no client installed, neither of which involved asking anybody, and the commit deleted every
 * `mcp_tools` row for the app: the recorded `effect`, `destructive` and, fatally, `version`, which
 * `callTool` refuses to run without and which only a listing can put back. So the two "asked
 * nobody" cases throw, and they throw SEPARATELY, because one sends an operator to this
 * deployment's configuration and the other to the row's url.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT REFUSED IS THE VENDOR'S OWN EMPTY PAGE, and it is worth saying why.
 * `@composio/core` used to manufacture one — `getRawComposioTools` ends `if (!tools) { return []; }`
 * (0.18.1, `src/models/Tools.ts:553-557`), so a response it could not read arrived here as the same
 * `[]` an app with no actions would send — and that particular hazard is gone with the wrapper:
 * `./composio-adapter` reads the raw client and refuses an answer that is not a page rather than
 * turning it into an empty one. What remains is the honest case, a listing Composio really did
 * answer with no rows, and that is answered a layer down rather than here — `store.ts`'s own
 * empty-listing guard keeps every recorded action,
 * its `effect`, its `destructive` and its `version` whenever an app that HAS actions lists none,
 * writes the sentence saying so, and stamps no refresh. Refusing here as well would buy nothing
 * that guard does not already hold, and would cost the case it is careful to allow: an app that
 * genuinely advertises nothing stays recordable, rather than reading as broken for good.

   * That is the string case's silent wrong answer again, one level in and failing the dangerous
   * way round rather than the cautious one, so it is answered the same way and in the same breath.
   * ASKED OF EVERY ELEMENT rather than of any, because a list that is mostly labels with one

/**
 * The one sentence in a thrown Composio error that is worth showing anybody.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT AN INLINE READ. The top-level message is "Error executing the tool
 * GMAIL_FETCH_EMAILS", which names nothing a reader could act on. The useful sentence — "No connected
 * account found for user ID … for toolkit gmail" — is nested two levels inside `cause`, beside the
 * entire HTTP response: headers, trace ids, rate-limit counters. So this reaches in for the sentence
 * and takes nothing else, because the alternative is somebody's request id in a model's context and
 * an audit row the size of a response dump.
 *
 * openbot already had this lesson from Drive, where a generic message cost a round of probing and the
 * vendor's own "The caller does not have permission" named the problem immediately.
 *
 * Null when there is no such sentence, which leaves the caller to choose a fallback rather than
 * inventing one here. That choice is not simply "the thrown message": the thrown message is often the
 * placeholder above, and passing it on tells the reader nothing. See {@link unexplained}.
 *
 * AND THE PLACEHOLDER IS NOT A SENTENCE WHEREVER IT SITS, which is the half this function was
 * missing. Both callers check {@link VENDOR_PLACEHOLDER} against the message that was THROWN and
 * both prefer this answer over that check, so "Error executing the tool X" arriving nested inside
 * `cause` — which is where the vendor puts it when their own gateway had nothing else to say —
 * went out past a guard written for exactly that string. A reader who asked for that tool learns
 * from it only that they asked; that is true at whatever depth it was found, so the judgement
 * belongs here, in the function whose whole job is deciding what is worth passing on.
 *
 * TRIMMED ON THE WAY OUT AND NOT ONLY IN THE GUARD. The two used to disagree — the guard measured a
 * trimmed string and the return handed back the padded one — so the decision the function had
 * already made about the string was thrown away at the last line. What comes out is read by a person
 * off an admin page, put in front of a model, and measured by {@link cap}, and in the third of those
 * the padding is counted against somebody's context window.
 *
 * AND IT IS LOOKED FOR AT BOTH DEPTHS THE VENDOR THROWS IT AT, which is the half that made this
 * function blind on five of this transport's calls. `cause.error.error.message` is the sentence
 * inside a wrapper — `ComposioToolExecutionError` keeps the API error as its `cause` — but
 * `@composio/core` 0.18.1 wraps only some of what it does. The auth-config and connected-account
 * listings and the raw tool listing all `await this.client.*` with no try around them
 * (`src/models/AuthConfigs.ts`, `src/models/ConnectedAccounts.ts`, `src/models/Tools.ts:552-555`),
 * and `./composio-adapter` calls both raw deletes on the client itself — so what those five throw
 * is `@composio/client`'s own `APIError`, which hangs the response body on `.error` and sets no
 * `cause` at all (`@composio/client` 0.1.0-alpha.76, `src/core/error.ts:9-24`). The sentence is one
 * level shallower there, and reaching past it cost the reader the vendor's own words on every one.
 *
 * WHAT IT COST THEM INSTEAD IS THE WHOLE REPLY. That class builds its own `message` as
 * `${"${status}"} ${"${JSON.stringify(body)}"}` wherever the body has no top-level `message`
 * (`src/core/error.ts:26-44`), and Composio's body puts its sentence at `error.message` — so the
 * fallback to the thrown message handed `lastError`, the audit row and a model's context a status
 * code followed by the entire response. See {@link VENDOR_RESPONSE_DUMP}, which refuses it.
 *
 * THE JUDGEMENT BELOW APPLIES AT BOTH DEPTHS, because that is why it lives in this function at all.
 * A second place to read the field would otherwise be a second way past the check on the vendor's
 * placeholder, on the blank string and on a `message` that is not a string — which is exactly the
 * bypass this function was written to close.

 * THE ONE DOOR. Whether a candidate string is worth showing anybody, and the trimmed string if so.
 *
 * EVERY READER OF A CANDIDATE SENTENCE IN THIS MODULE ASKS THROUGH HERE, and that is the whole
 * point of it rather than a tidiness. There are four places a string is picked up and handed to a
 * model, to an administrator reading `lastError` off the Plugins page, or to `store.ts`'s audit
 * row: the two depths {@link vendorSentence} reaches, the message a failure was THROWN with, the
 * `error` field of a resolved envelope, and the reason a serialization failed. Each of them used to
 * make this judgement itself, and the judgement then drifted — which is not a hypothesis. A first
 * extraction moved the blank and the placeholder rules into one place and left the `error` field
 * reading `VENDOR_PLACEHOLDER` inline; {@link VENDOR_RESPONSE_DUMP} was then added to the extracted
 * side only, so a status code followed by an entire response body was refused where it was thrown
 * and passed on where it was reported. The fix for that is not a third copy of the rule. It is that
 * there is nowhere left to put one.
 *
 * THREE REFUSALS, AND THEY ARE THE SAME REFUSAL. A blank string, "Error executing the tool X" and
 * "502 {…}" are one condition wearing three shapes: the vendor emitted something where an
 * explanation belongs and none of it explains anything. What each caller does about a null differs
 * — one falls through to the next depth, one to this deployment's own words — and that is the part
 * that belongs to the caller. What is NOT worth passing on does not vary by door, and the moment it
 * is allowed to, the guard is decoration.
 *
 * A NON-STRING IS NOT A SENTENCE, which is why the parameter is `unknown` rather than `string`. The
 * types in this file are its own projection of somebody else's JSON; a `message` that is a number,
 * an object or a list reaches a reader as `1810` or `[object Object]`, and collapsing all of those

 * administrator can do to this row will help and upgrading the package will.
 *
 * IT IS A CLAIM ABOUT THE SEAM NOW RATHER THAN ABOUT THE ADAPTER, which is worth saying because it
 * used to be the other way round. This branch was written for `getRawComposioTools`, whose last act
 * was `ToolSchema.parse`, and the listing does not go through it any more: `./composio-adapter`
 * reads `client.tools.list`, which parses nothing, so today's implementation of
 * {@link ComposioActions.listActions} cannot raise a `ZodError` here. What the branch still covers
 * is the seam — a `ComposioActions` is anything satisfying two methods — and a sentence naming the
 * package remains the only useful thing to say about a zod complaint arriving through one. Deleting
 * it would leave that answer to be reconstructed by whoever meets it; what would be wrong is
 * keeping a comment that says the adapter throws it.
 *
 * THE PLACEHOLDER IS REFUSED HERE ON THE SAME GROUNDS {@link callTool} REFUSES IT, which is the
 * half this function was missing. "Error executing the tool X" names only the thing the reader
 * asked for; on this path they asked to refresh an app, so it is the one fact they already had.
 * Falling through to the app's name at least tells them which row went wrong.
 *
 * AND A SENTENCE THIS DEPLOYMENT AUTHORED BEATS ANYTHING THE VENDOR SAID, which is the half it was
 * missing after that. This function consulted `brokerSentence` nowhere at all, and it is the rule
 * `routes.ts` follows (`brokerRefusal`, `:89-91`) and the rule {@link callTool}'s own catch was
 * corrected to. `./composio-adapter`'s `askVendor` wraps the raw tool listing exactly as it wraps
 * the execute, so a {@link BrokerRefusalError} arrives on this path as readily as on that one —
 * and the class is the promise that makes preferring it safe: `./broker` raises one only where the
 * sentence names the step that fixes the condition and is safe to show anybody who could have
 * asked. A failure it cannot explain stays a plain `Error` and falls through to the vendor's own
 * words below, exactly as before.
 *
 * WHAT IT WAS LOSING TO IS A READ ONE LEVEL SHALLOW, the same way `callTool`'s was. `vendorRefusal`
 * authors only where {@link vendorSentence} of the ORIGINAL error was null, so the vendor keeps the
 * last word wherever it had one; asking the same question of the WRAPPER reaches through its

/**
 * What the vendor said about its own call, read from BOTH fields its schema requires it to send.
 *
 * EITHER ONE CAN REPORT A FAILURE, and reading only the flag dropped the other. `successful ===
 * false` is the plain case. The second is an `error` sentence arriving beside `successful: true`:
 * `ToolExecuteResponseSchema` spells the two as independent required fields and correlates them
 * nowhere, and `transformToolExecuteResponse` copies both straight off the wire (`@composio/core`
 * 0.18.1, `src/models/Tools.ts:215-222`), so that combination is a shape the vendor's own schema
 * permits. Keyed on the flag alone it was audited as `mcp.call_succeeded` and the one sentence
 * saying what went wrong was shown to nobody.
 *
 * TAKING THE ERROR AT ITS WORD IS THE VENDOR'S OWN ARITHMETIC rather than a rule invented here:
 * where the SDK has to derive the flag itself it writes `successful: !response.error` (`:1247`). It
 * is also the reading this file already applies to a vendor contradicting itself — see
 * {@link effectOf} on `destructiveHint` beside `readOnlyHint`.
 *
 * WHICH IS EQUALLY WHY THE CRITERION IS A NON-EMPTY SENTENCE. By that same line `""` is a success,
 * so an empty `error` is the vendor saying nothing went wrong in the least committal way open to it.
 * Whitespace is read as empty too, and that part is this file's own reading rather than the SDK's —
 * it matches {@link vendorSentence}, because a blank sentence beside an explicit `successful: true`
 * would otherwise become a refusal saying only that the call failed and nobody said why.
 *
 * AND THE FLAG IS READ FOR ITS SHAPE BEFORE IT IS READ FOR ITS VALUE, which is the half this
 * function was missing for as long as the `error` beside it had it. `successful !== false` asked
 * one question of a field with three answers: `"false"`, `0` and `null` are none of them `false`,
 * so each one passed as a success, and a reported failure was handed to the model as content and
 * written to the audit trail as `mcp.call_succeeded`. Falsiness is not the repair either — it
 * answers `"false"` correctly by accident, since a non-empty string is truthy, and would still
 * take `0` for a considered "no" rather than for a field nobody here can read.
 *
 * SO A NON-BOOLEAN IS THE THIRD KIND OF FAILURE, exactly as an unreadable `error` is, and it gets
 * the wording that kind is owed: nothing was reported, so nothing can be passed on as the vendor's
 * report, and what this deployment has to say is that it cannot tell whether the action ran. The
 * old comment here argued that an ABSENT flag must not be read as a failure, which was right and
 * is now settled one step earlier — {@link envelopeGap} refuses an answer that carries no
 * `successful` at all, as not being the envelope. What is left to this function is a field that
 * arrived, and a field that arrived saying something unreadable is the vendor speaking, not the
 * vendor silent.
 *
 * THE VENDOR'S OWN SENTENCE STILL COMES FIRST, which is why the shape check sits below the
 * sentence rather than above it. `{ error: "Gmail rejected the query", successful: "false" }` is a
 * failure whichever way the flag is read, and the reader is better served by what Composio said
 * about it than by this file's remark that the flag was malformed. The check is reached only where
 * the alternative would be calling the answer a success.
 *
 * AN `error` THAT IS NOT A SENTENCE IS NOT SILENCE, and reading the field through a `typeof` that
 * collapsed everything else to `""` made the two indistinguishable. `{ message: … }`, or the list
 * of issues a gateway puts there, arriving beside `successful: true` came out of here as null: the
 * call was handed to the model as content, `store.ts` audited `mcp.call_succeeded`, and the field
 * the vendor put its complaint in was shown to nobody. Which branch it takes turns on the flag,
 * because the two say different things. Beside `successful: false` the vendor has already reported
 * the failure and only its reason is unreadable, which is what {@link unexplained} is for. Beside
 * anything else nothing here knows whether the action ran at all — the third kind of failure
 * {@link callTool} names, ours rather than the vendor's, and so worded in our own words.
 *
 * Null when there is nothing to report, so the caller can tell "succeeded" from "failed silently".
 *
 * AND EVERY BRANCH SAYS WHETHER COMPOSIO ANSWERED ABOUT THE CALL, which is the second thing this
 * function has always decided and never said out loud. Read the sentences below: three of them end
 * "so nothing here can tell whether the action ran", and the other two are the vendor reporting a
 * failure of a call it made. That is exactly the {@link ActionAnswer} split — a failure OUT THERE
 * against a failure to find out — and returning it beside the sentence is what keeps the two from
 * being re-derived by matching on prose. See {@link ActionAnswer} for who needs the distinction and
 * what it destroyed while nothing carried it.

 * this transport refusing before it dialled, and an answer this deployment could not read — and
 * only the third is Composio running the action in somebody's account and reporting what came back.
 * For a model reading a result that difference does not change anything: the call did not work and
 * the sentence says why, which is why {@link callTool} still answers the flat shape and every
 * ordinary caller goes on using it.
 *
 * FOR A CALL THAT IS A VERIFICATION IT IS THE WHOLE MEANING. `probeBrokeredConnection` spends one
 * call to find out whether a key works and writes the answer down as a verdict on somebody's
 * account — so reading `isError` as that verdict made a COMPOSIO OUTAGE into a rejected key, and
 * the consequences were destructive at both callers: on connect the account the person had just
 * made was deleted at the vendor and they were told what they entered did not work; on re-check a
 * working connection's verification was cleared and its row marked as holding a bad key. A vendor
 * nobody could reach is a fourth thing beside connected, checked and works, and it has no state on
 * the row because it is not a fact about the connection at all — it is the absence of one.
 *
 * `answered: true` IS NARROW ON PURPOSE, and it is exactly one thing: Composio resolved with its
 * envelope, this deployment could read it, and what it said — a result, or the app's own error — is
 * a statement about the call that ran. Everything else is `false`, INCLUDING the failures that are
 * this deployment's own fault, because a caller asking "may I treat this as a verdict" is owed the
 * same no for a package that cannot parse an answer as for a socket that closed. The direction to
 * be wrong in is settled by what each mistake costs: a reachable vendor misread as unreachable
 * leaves a key unchecked, which the Re-check button fixes, and an unreachable vendor misread as a
