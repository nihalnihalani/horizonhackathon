/**
 * Google Drive, reached over its ordinary REST API instead of its MCP server.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Google publishes a hosted MCP server for Drive, `drivemcp.googleapis.com`, and
 * pointing the catalogue at it was the original design: a vendor-maintained server needs no code
 * here at all. It is gated behind the Google Workspace Developer Preview Program, and refuses an
 * unenrolled project with `The caller does not have permission` — a statement about the project,
 * not the credential, so every check available locally says the setup is correct. It is.
 *
 * The REST API underneath has been generally available since 2015. So this trades "no code" for "no
 * dependency on a preview", which for a connector people rely on is the better side of the trade.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SWAPPABLE. This module implements the interface {@link ./mcp} already had —
 * `listTools` and `callTool`, same shapes — rather than inventing one for itself. MCP is therefore
 * not the default with an exception carved out of it; both are implementations of the same contract,
 * chosen per catalogue entry by {@link ./access} and looked up in {@link ./transport}. Going back to
 * the MCP server when the preview opens is one field on one entry, with nothing else in the system
 * aware it changed.
 *
 * The TOOL NAMES are deliberately the ones Google's MCP server advertises, character for character.
 * A grant is stored as `google-drive/search_files`, so keeping the names identical means every grant
 * an administrator has already made keeps working across the swap, in either direction. Diverging
 * here would silently turn switching transports into re-granting every tool on every Bot.
 *
 * Read-only, and only the tools that can be implemented faithfully. Google's MCP server also
 * advertises writes; the `drive.readonly` scope refuses them, and nothing here offers them.
