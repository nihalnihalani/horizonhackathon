/**
 * A person's standing instructions: keeping them, and guarding them.
 *
 * THIS FILE HAS TWO HALVES, AND THEY ARE SEPARABLE ON PURPOSE. The half below is the one a person
 * touches: create, list, change, remove, switch off. It is asked questions through a Bot, so every
 * refusal is a sentence a model can act on, every statement is guarded by the owner, and the owner is
 * never taken from an argument a model supplied. Its failures are one person's failures — a bad cron,
 * a channel they are not in — and none of them are about two things happening at once.
 *
 * The other half is the sweep's, and it starts at the marked boundary further down: the ledger read
 * on a clock (which routines are due, advancing the next run, opening and closing a run row).
 * Nothing there is asked a question by a person, and everything there is about concurrency — several
 * replicas reading the same due row in the same second. That is why the halves are worth telling
 * apart: only the second one has anything to do with concurrency, and only the second one needs to be
 * reasoned about as a race.
 *
 * NO CLAIM OR LEASE MACHINERY, EVER. Firing mechanics belong to the shared `work_items` queue in
 * `server/src/work/queue.ts`, which already owns `for update skip locked`, leases on the database's
 * clock, and an attempt count. A second lease grown on the routines table — a `claimed_by`, a
 * `locked_until` — is exactly the duplicated firing mechanism #235 exists to prevent: two half-right
 * implementations of the same hard thing, one of which nobody tests.

       * comparison reads back truncated — and the CAS would stop matching, silently, for ever. This
