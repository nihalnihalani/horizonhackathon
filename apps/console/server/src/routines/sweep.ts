/**
 * Turning "this routine is due" into exactly one firing, on a clock, across replicas.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, LIKE `server/src/work/culler.ts`, and separated for its reason: deciding what should
 * fire is not the same act as firing it. This half reads the ledger and puts an item on the shared
 * queue; the next one claims those items and dispatches them. So whichever replica noticed does not
 * have to be the one that carries it out, and a dispatch that dies halfway is picked up by whoever
 * claims it next rather than lost with the process that saw it was due.
 *
 * Two free functions over one options type rather than a factory, again like the culler, so the two
 * halves cannot drift about what a lease, an owner or a limit means: there is one description of the
 * things they share, and both read it.
 *
 * THE OFFER KEY IS THE WHOLE IDEMPOTENCE STORY. It carries the minute the firing was due, so three
 * replicas waking at 09:00 produce one work item and one run. That holds only while every replica
 * renders that minute identically, which is why the format is pinned in one function below and
 * asserted literally in `server/tests/routine-sweep.integration.test.ts`.
 *
 * NO CLAIM OR LEASE MACHINERY HERE, and none on the routines table. `server/src/work/queue.ts`
 * already owns `for update skip locked`, leases named on the database's clock and an attempt count.
 * A second half-right copy grown next to it is the duplicated firing mechanism #235 exists to
 * prevent.
