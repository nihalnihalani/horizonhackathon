/**

 * (`https://gateway.internal/v1`), because that is the shape the AI SDK wants: it takes `baseURL`
 * verbatim and asks for `/chat/completions` under it, which is how the built-in Bots reach the same
 * endpoint. Appending here produced `/v1/v1/chat/completions`, so on a gateway — the entire reason
 * the variable exists — every call from this function 404'd.
 *
 * That failure was invisible, which is the worst part. The router treats a throw as "not sure" and
 * lands on the default coworker, so a deployment behind a gateway silently stopped routing and
 * nothing anywhere said why. Tool selection reads through the same function and would have failed
 * the same way, offering the whole catalogue on the deployments most likely to have a big one.
 *
 * So the version segment is added only when the configured URL does not already end in one, and the
 * unset case keeps the public API's own `https://api.openai.com/v1`.
