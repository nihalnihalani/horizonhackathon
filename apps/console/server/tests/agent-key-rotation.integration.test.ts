/**
 * Editing a Bot's key, against a real database.
 *
 * The rotation tests elsewhere hand `storeAgentAuth` a fake store, which can answer any call
 * instantly and holds no locks. That is enough to prove which vault call is made and useless for
 * proving the call can be made at all: every failure this file exists to catch is a lock taken by
 * one connection and waited for by another, and a fake has neither.
 *
 * The pool is pinned to one connection deliberately. A second vault write on its own connection is
 * a second session competing with the transaction the edit is already inside, and at `max: 1` it
 * cannot even be handed a connection until that transaction ends — which it never will, because the
 * transaction is awaiting the call. The edit hangs until something times it out. At the driver's
 * default pool the same shape survives as a row-lock wait instead, slower to hit and identical in
 * effect, so one connection is the honest setting for the question being asked.
