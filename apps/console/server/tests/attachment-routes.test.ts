/*
 * THIS TEST USED TO PIN THE BUG IT WAS MEANT TO GUARD.
 *
 * It posted `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES + 1` bytes and asserted, POSITIVELY, that the refusal was NOT JSON —
 * `expect(() => JSON.parse(text)).toThrow()` — using hono's plain-text `Payload Too Large` as the
 * way to tell the door's 413 from the handler's. Both halves of that premise were themselves
 * defects, and the door has since been fixed on both counts (`server/src/app.ts`).
 *
 * The size was wrong because the door measures THE ENVELOPE and every other gate measures THE FILE:
 * `bodyLimit` runs before anything has parsed the body, so the multipart boundary, the part headers
 * and the `uploadGroup` field (~360 bytes as the composer sends them) counted against the file's own
 * ceiling. A file at exactly the published 8MB limit was refused. The door now sits at
 * `UPLOAD_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`, so `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES + 1` sails through it — and the handler is what
 * refuses that one, naming the file. This test's old size now reaches `requireUser` and answers 503.
 *
 * The shape was wrong because the composer reads `{ error }` off every failure
 * (`app/src/components/channels/composer/attachments.ts`) and falls back to a generic sentence when
 * the body will not parse — so on the one refusal whose reason is both knowable and actionable, the
 * person was told nothing. The door now answers JSON, which is what the assertion below requires.
 *
 * No assertion that lets a file at the ceiling through can also keep the old one: the two sizes
 * differ by one byte and the framing is ~360, so whatever the door's number is, `ceiling + 1` is on
 * the same side of it as the ceiling. The discriminator has to be something other than the shape of
 * the refusal, and it is: a body past the DOOR'S own ceiling can only have been refused by the door.
