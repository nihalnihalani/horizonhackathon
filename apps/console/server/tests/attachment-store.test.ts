/*
 * THE ONE TEST THAT CARRIES BYTES THROUGH BOTH DOORS AND COMPARES THEM.

 * It used to claim to be the only test that used the upload route at all, and that has not been
 * true for a while: `attachment-routes.test.ts` uploads through the route and fetches the result
 * back in several places — the SVG-body case, the over-long filename case, the cap races. What none
 * of those do is compare the BYTES. They assert statuses, headers and stored names, so a POST
 * handler that wrote `bytes.slice(0, 1)` or `sizeBytes: 0` would keep every one of them green.
 *
 * That is what this one is for, and the claim is worth keeping narrow so it stays true. Most
 * attachment tests still seed their rows with a direct insert, which leaves the route's own
 * handling of the body asserted by nothing; here the bytes are compared against the buffer the
 * REQUEST was built from — not against anything read back out of the table — and the headers are
 * read off the response rather than derived from the row, so a regression anywhere between the
 * multipart body and the served response is a failure here.
