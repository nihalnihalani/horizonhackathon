 * A component's `name` is its identity: `syncCatalogue` compares it against the names already
 * published, `decide` and `listForAgent` look it up by it, and a grant names it. A name that
 * differs from another only by the spaces around it is therefore a second, separate component that
 * nobody granted and no Bot can be held back from by the name people actually use.
