/**

 * WHY THIS FILE IS THE IMPORTANT ONE. Three separate decisions used to be derived independently at
 * three call sites: which protocol dials, whose credential is spent, and whose name goes in the audit
 * row. Each derived it from a different field, and a Composio row — which has no catalogue entry at
 * all — answered every one of them wrongly by default: MCP would dial `composio://gmail` as if it
 * were an HTTP server, the credential branch would return no token and proceed, and the trail would
 * say the deployment made a call that ran in somebody's mailbox.
 *
 * One table of expected answers, one row per row-shape that exists. A new kind of server that nobody
 * adds a row for here is a test that fails, which is the property the old three-string-checks
 * arrangement could not have.

  /**
   * AND A BROKERED APP THAT NEEDS NO CREDENTIAL IS REACHED AS THE DEPLOYMENT.
   *
   * CRITERION. A `composio` row whose recorded scheme is `NO_AUTH` answers `deployment`, while every
   * other brokered row — an unrecorded scheme included — still answers `person`.
   *
   * REASON. This answered `person` for every brokered row, because the only fields it had were the
   * provenance and the url and neither can tell. A `NO_AUTH` app has no account and no
   * `composio_connections` row: `connectionTokenFor` lets such a call through with no row at all and
   * `/servers/:id/connect` refuses to ever create one. So for Hacker News — Composio's own `NO_AUTH`
   * — every audit row wrote `reachedAs: <actorId>`, each one claiming the call ran in that person's
   * own account at the vendor: an account they never connected and cannot disconnect. That is
   * exactly what the field's docblock names as `deployment`: "a public endpoint reached with no
   * credential at all, where every person's call sees the same data and naming the asker would
   * assert an attribution that does not exist."
   *
   * THE UNRECORDED SCHEME IS THE THIRD ROW AND IS THE DELIBERATE DIRECTION. A brokered row whose
   * column was never written is far likelier to be a key or consent app than a no-auth one, and
   * `person` is the answer that does not under-attribute a call that really did run in somebody's
   * mailbox.
