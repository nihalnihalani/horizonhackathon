/**
 * One real call to Composio, so the shapes this transport is written against are the shapes it gets.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, when everything else here runs against a stub. Three separate assumptions in
 * an earlier draft were wrong — a call needs a specific version, failures throw rather than resolving
 * with an error field, and the useful sentence is nested two levels inside the cause — and every one of
 * them passed the whole stubbed suite. A stub asserts what its author believed. This asserts what the
 * vendor does.
 *
 * WRITTEN AGAINST THE VENDOR'S TYPES, WITH NO `as never`. `server/tsconfig.json` does not include
 * `tests`, so nothing in the build type-checks this file — which means a cast here erases the only
 * place in the repo where the real SDK surface is named, and erasing it defeats the one job the file
 * has. Every call below is typed by `@composio/core` itself. Where a value has to be narrowed, it is
 * narrowed by a runtime check that says what was missing, not by a cast that asserts it was there.
 *
 * SKIPPED WITHOUT A KEY, so CI and a contributor with no Composio account are unaffected. Run it
 * deliberately: `OPENBOT_LIVE_COMPOSIO=1 COMPOSIO_API_KEY=... bun test tests/composio-live.test.ts`.
 *
 * IT READS AND IT FAILS ON PURPOSE. Every action it calls is a read; the user id it calls for is one
 * nobody has connected, and the one action it calls that is allowed to reach a third party is a
 * no-auth public lookup of a record that does not exist. So the calls cannot touch anybody's data —
 * the failure is the assertion.
