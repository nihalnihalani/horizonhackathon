   * it gave was true of the WRAPPER: "`ToolListParamsSchema` accepts no cursor and
   * `getRawComposioTools` drops the response's `next_cursor`, so one page at the API's stated
   * maximum is the largest listing expressible through this SDK".
   *
   * IT IS NOT TRUE OF THE VENDOR. `@composio/client`'s `ToolListParams` carries a `cursor` and its
   * `ToolListResponse` carries `next_cursor` (0.1.0-alpha.76, `resources/tools.d.ts:421-432`,
   * `:200-204`), and `./composio-adapter` now reads that client and follows the cursor to the end.
   * A listing this long is an app with a lot of actions, and refusing it would be refusing a
   * complete answer — which is what the same ceiling, one file over, was doing to the app picker
   * on every single call.
   *
   * SO WHAT IS ASSERTED IS THE INVERSE, AT THE SAME BOUNDARY. The seam below hands back a full page
   * because that is what the adapter's pager resolves to once it has read every page; this module's
   * job is to commit it rather than to second-guess its length. The refusals this module still
   * makes — an empty listing, an unreadable row, a listing that did not answer — are unmoved, and

/**
 * WHICH FAILURES ARE THE VENDOR'S VERDICT AND WHICH ARE THIS DEPLOYMENT NOT FINDING OUT.
 *
 * `isError` is one flag over three kinds of failure — this transport refusing before it dialled,
 * Composio reporting a failure of a call it made, and an answer nothing here can read — and for a
 * model reading a result that is the right amount of detail: the call did not work, and the sentence
 * says why. For a caller writing the answer down as a verdict on somebody's credential it is not:
 * `probeBrokeredConnection` spends one call to find out whether a key works, and reading `isError`
 * as that verdict made a Composio OUTAGE into a rejected key — which deleted the account somebody
 * had just made and told them their key was refused, and, at the other caller, cleared a working
 * connection's verification.
 *
 * SO THE SEAM ANSWERS IT, and this is where the classification itself is pinned. Each case below is
 * one branch of `askAction`, asserted on the `answered` flag rather than on the sentence, because a
 * sentence is prose and this is a contract: `answered: true` means Composio ran the action in the
 * account and said how it went, and nothing else in the module may claim it.
