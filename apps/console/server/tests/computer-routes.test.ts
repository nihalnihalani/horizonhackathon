 * The route checks `:kind` against the four gestures a person's mouse and keyboard produce, and then

 * had just been checked. The gateway puts that value straight into the path it calls on the
 * computer, so the check decided one thing and the request went somewhere else.
 *
 * This route is the one that deliberately skips the policy decision and the audit row, because a
 * takeover exists so a person can type the thing nothing should keep. That makes it the worst one to
 * be able to redirect: nothing downstream writes the row that would have shown where it went.
