/**
 * The snapshot a ref resolves against has to cross to another server.
 *
 * The gateway turns the opaque ref in a click into the element it points at by looking it up in the
 * snapshot this deployment took. OpenBot runs several processes behind a load balancer, and the one
 * that takes the snapshot is rarely the one that answers the click, so that mapping cannot live in a
 * `Map` in a process: on every other replica it would be empty, the policy would decide with no
 * element, and the boundary would be silently off. The row is the contract that carries the mapping
 * from the server that snapshotted to the server that acts.
 *
 * Another replica is simulated by building a second store on the same database, the way the policy
 * durability test simulates a restart. Reading back through the same store would only prove it
 * remembers what it was told a moment ago, which is not the property in question.
