 * The address goes to Bun in parts, and `$DATABASE_URL` does not survive the call.
 *
 * Both halves matter and only together. Bun reads a connection URL's path as the path of a unix
 * socket, so `postgres://…/openbot` cannot connect on Windows (oven-sh/bun#27713); and it prefers
 * `$DATABASE_URL` to the options it was handed, so passing the parts while the variable is still
 * set changes nothing. These assert the observable half: what the environment looks like
 * afterwards, and which addresses are refused before a socket is ever opened.
