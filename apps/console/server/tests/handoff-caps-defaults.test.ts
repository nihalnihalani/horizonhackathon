/**
 * One number, written down in four places.
 *
 * The caps have a fallback in `config.ts`, a default in the chart's `values.yaml`, a second default
 * in `_helpers.tpl` (which has to be there, because `--reuse-values` leaves the values key absent on
 * an existing release), and a figure quoted in `docs/configuration.md`. The helper always renders
 * the variable, so on Kubernetes the code fallback never runs and the docs describe a source the
 * deployment is not using.
 *
 * Nothing here can merge them: they are read by three different things at three different times. So
 * they are held together, and the next person to change one finds out here rather than from an
 * operator debugging a refusal against a number their deployment never had.
 */

/*
 * Resolved from this file rather than from the working directory. Both reads are at the top level,
 * so a relative path that misses takes the whole file's tests with it and reports nothing: the suite
 * gets smaller and stays green. That is what `bun test` from inside `server/` used to do.
