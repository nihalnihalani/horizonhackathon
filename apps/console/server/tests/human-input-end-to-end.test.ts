/**
 * The whole path a person's input takes, over a real socket.
 *
 * The unit tests either side of this one stub the fetch, which means the URL they assert on is a
 * string this process built rather than a request anything received. The thing being prevented here
 * is a request ARRIVING somewhere it should not, and only a listener can say where one arrived: the
 * `..` in `/human/../exec` is resolved by URL parsing inside fetch, so a test that reads the string
 * it passed in is describing its own argument. This one starts a server, drives the real router
 * through the real gateway and the real transport, and asks the server what it got.
 *
 * It stands in for `agent-computer` rather than running it, because that process opens Chromium at
 * import time. What it reproduces is the part that matters: an HTTP API on the other end of the
 * transport, with endpoints beyond the four this route is allowed to reach.
