 * A jsonb column must hold JSON, not a string that looks like it.
 *
 * Drizzle's `jsonb()` serialises the value and Bun's SQL driver serialises it again, so this codebase
 * uses a custom type for objects that must stay queryable with JSON operators. The audit trail depends
 * on `payload->>'bot'` and related SQL reads returning fields from an object, not from a JSON string.
 *
 * These assertions are deliberately made in SQL, against a real database, on the shape of the stored
 * value rather than on what comes back through the application.
