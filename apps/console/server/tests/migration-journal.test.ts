/**
 * The migration journal, which decides what actually runs.
 *
 * Drizzle applies a migration when its journal `when` is later than the newest one the database has
 * recorded, so the ordering that matters is the timestamps, not the file names. A migration stamped
 * ahead of real time therefore does not merely sort oddly: it silently swallows every migration
 * authored after it until the clock catches up, and `drizzle-kit migrate` reports success while
 * doing it.
 *
 * That happened here. `0012` was hand-written with `when = previous + 86_400_000`, a day into the
 * future, and the next migration to arrive carried a real timestamp, so it was older by comparison.
 * `migrate` said "migrations applied successfully!", the table it should have created did not exist,
 * and the only symptom was an integration test failing with `relation "skill_tools" does not exist`.
 *
 * Nothing else in the build would have caught that, which is why this is a test rather than a note.
