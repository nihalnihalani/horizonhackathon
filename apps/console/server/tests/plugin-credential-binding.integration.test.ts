/**
 * Which address a stored credential may be spent against, and whose it has to be.
 *
 * Pointing a server at a credential is the one place this deployment accepts a *reference* to a
 * secret rather than the secret itself. Everywhere else that a stored value is spent, the value was
 * typed into the same request that stores it: `storeAgentAuth` mints its own row from the key an
 * administrator pasted and hands back an id nobody chose. So this is the field where "which secret"
 * and "which address" can be made to disagree, and the add is what settles the disagreement, because
 * the refresh runs before it returns and sends what it decrypts to the URL from that same request.
 *
 * Two rules, and the second is the one that matters. Naming another server's token was accepted, so
 * a credential could be spent by a server it was never given to. And re-adding a server with a
 * different URL rewrote the address while keeping the credential, so the same token could be sent
 * somewhere else entirely without any cross-server trick at all. Closing only the first leaves the
 * second, which is why they are one question here rather than two.
