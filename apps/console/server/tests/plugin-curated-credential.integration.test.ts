/**
 * Which credential a curated server is allowed to be pointed at.
 *
 * `addCustomServer` was given this rule and `addServer`, one function above it, was not: it takes the
 * same `credentialId` from the same administrator's request and stored it unread. The two paths are
 * a pair, and a guard on one of them is a guard on the path somebody happened to look at.
 *
 * What is reachable today is narrower than the custom case and worth stating rather than dressing
 * up. `mcp_servers.credential_id` is a real foreign key, so an id naming nothing is refused by the
 * database, and the one entry in the catalogue is `user-oauth`, whose client is registered through
 * `registerOAuthClient` and sent to a pinned vendor address. What is left is a credential of the
 * wrong kind being accepted and spent, a malformed id arriving as a database error where a refusal
 * belongs, and the whole hole reopening the moment a fork re-adds a `deployment-bearer` vendor,
 * which the catalogue's own comment invites.
