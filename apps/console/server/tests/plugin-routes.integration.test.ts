/**
 * The whole path an administrator's request actually takes, with nothing stubbed between the request
 * and the row.
 *
 * The two halves are covered on their own: the store's refusals against a real database, and the
 * route's mapping of them against a stubbed store. Both passing does not prove the pair is wired
 * together, and the failure that would live in the gap is quiet in exactly the way that matters: a
 * refusal that reaches the browser as a 500 reads as a broken deployment rather than a correctable
 * mistake, and a refusal that stops short of the write leaves a row pointing at a credential the
 * next refresh spends. So this asks the question end to end and then looks in the table.
