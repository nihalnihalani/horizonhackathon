/**
 * A boundary an administrator changes has to reach every server, not the one that served the request.
 *
 * OpenBot runs several servers behind a load balancer. The policy is read from memory on every single
 * action, which is right: a query per keystroke would be absurd. What was wrong is that memory was
 * only ever filled at boot, so a new deny rule applied on the one server that happened to receive it
 * and nowhere else. The admin screen reported success, because the row really was saved, and the
 * audit trail agreed, because it records the boundary each process started with. Both were honest and
 * both were describing something other than what the fleet was enforcing.
 *
 * A deny rule that stops roughly one action in N is worse than no deny rule at all: it looks like it
 * works, so nobody goes looking.
 *
 * Another server is simulated by a second store on the same database with its own listener, the way
 * the durability test simulates a restart. Reading back through the store that wrote it would only
 * prove it remembers what it was told a moment ago, which was never the failure.
