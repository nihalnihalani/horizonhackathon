/**
 * Both halves of the sweep against a real PostgreSQL and the real `work_items` queue.
 *
 * A fake queue cannot answer the only question worth asking here. The whole reason a routine fires
 * once when three replicas wake at 09:00 is a primary key on `(kind, key)` and
 * `on conflict do nothing`, which is a promise the database makes; a stub that remembered what it
 * had been offered would pass every test below while production produced three runs.
 *
 * THIS FILE OWNS `ROUTINE_FIRE_KIND`. Unlike `work-queue.integration.test.ts`, which invents a
 * per-file kind, the kind under test here is a shared constant, so the rows cannot be namespaced
 * away — the cleanup below deletes every row of that kind. A second test file that offers this kind
 * would race this one and both would flake. Put such tests here.
 *
 * NO CLAIM, LEASE OR OWNERSHIP INTERNALS ARE TESTED HERE. `for update skip locked`, leases named on
 * the database's clock and the attempt count belong to `work-queue.integration.test.ts`. What this
 * file tests is which firings the sweep decides are worth offering, and — for the consuming half —
 * whether the consumer honours the booleans the queue hands back: a `renew` that says the lease has
 * gone, a `finish` that says the item was not ours, an attempt count that has reached its cap.
