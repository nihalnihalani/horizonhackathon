/**
 * Why a conversation went where it went, for every conversation.
 *
 * `channel.routed` carries a `viaMention` field that was hardcoded false at the only place the row
 * was written, so it could never be true. The reason was structural rather than a typo: naming a
 * coworker with `@` short-circuited the router in the composer, so that code never ran and no row
 * was written at all.
 *
 * Four routings in a validation pass, every one `viaMention=false`, and a conversation sent to Risk
 * Analyst through the picker that produced tool calls recorded against `bot=risk-analyst` with no
 * `channel.routed` row anywhere near it. The mention worked; the trail could not say so, and a
 * missing row is indistinguishable from one that failed to write.
 *
 * So the choice is recorded too, and these hold both halves: the field earns its place, and the
 * model is never asked a question the person already answered.
