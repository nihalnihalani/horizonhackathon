/**
 * Whether this deployment lets every visitor in as one administrator.
 *
 * The most dangerous boolean in the codebase and it had no test. It used to be locked with
 * `NODE_ENV === "production"`, which is exactly the wrong way round: `NODE_ENV` is unset unless
 * somebody sets it, so a container on a VM with a hand-written env file and no identity provider
 * served the whole internet as an administrator, silently, because nothing was wrong from the
 * outside. It now takes an explicit flag and refuses to start without one.
 *
 * The cases below are the four a deployment can actually be in.
 *
 * This function still reads only the flag, which is what these cases pin, and `NODE_ENV` still
 * decides nothing here. Whether a deployment may HAVE no sign-in is a second question, asked by
 * `singleUserAllowed` in config.ts, which refuses it on any address other people can reach. The old
 * lock is not back: that one granted permission from a variable unset by default, and this one only
 * ever adds a refusal.
