 * The minimum environment a deployment is allowed to boot with, for tests that need a config but are
 * not testing configuration itself.
 *
 * It lives in one place because the minimum is a moving target: Intelligence became mandatory and
 * five test files each carried their own copy of the environment, so every one of them started
 * failing for a reason that had nothing to do with what it was testing. Tests that assert on
 * configuration should keep building their environment inline; everything else should spread this.
