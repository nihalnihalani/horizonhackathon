 * Text files are not downscaled, so this is a hard refusal like `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE LIMIT THAT DECIDES WHAT REACHES THE MODEL, AND THE TWO NUMBERS ARE FAR APART.
 * `MAX_EXTRACTED_CHARACTERS` below is 120,000, and this is 1,048,576. A file accepted at this
 * ceiling is stored whole and then handed to the model as its first 120,000 characters — for
 * ASCII-ish text, where a byte is a character, roughly its first EIGHTH, with about 89% cut. Text
 * in a script that costs several bytes per character loses proportionally less, because the
 * ceilings are counted in different units, but a file anywhere near this size is cut.
 *
 * The two are deliberately different numbers because they bound different things, and neither can
 * stand in for the other:
 *
 *   - this one bounds what is UPLOADED, STORED and SERVED — bandwidth, disk, and the size of the
 *     response `/api/attachments/:id` has to produce;
 *   - `MAX_EXTRACTED_CHARACTERS` bounds what one attachment may spend of a shared CONTEXT WINDOW,
 *     which is a budget split with the conversation and with up to seven other attachments.
 *
 * REJECTED: lowering this to 120,000 so the two agree. It would refuse files the app can already
 * do something useful with — the first 120,000 characters of a large CSV usually answers the
 * question that was asked of it — and would trade a partial read for no read at all.
 *
 * REJECTED: raising `MAX_EXTRACTED_CHARACTERS` to match this. A megabyte of text is a few hundred
 * thousand tokens, which is the context window this deployment targets spent entirely on one
 * attachment. That is the outcome that constant exists to prevent.
 *
 * So the gap stays, and what it costs is stated here rather than left for somebody to derive by
 * dividing one constant by the other. What is NOT yet resolved is that the person who uploads the
 * file is not told — see `MAX_EXTRACTED_CHARACTERS`.

 * thousand tokens and would fill the window on its own. 120,000 characters is roughly 30,000
 * tokens, which every model this deployment targets can hold alongside a conversation. Text past
 * this point is cut and the part says so, rather than being silently dropped.
 *
 * THE PART SAYS SO TO THE MODEL. NOBODY SAYS SO TO THE PERSON WHO ATTACHED THE FILE.
 *
 * `extractDocumentText` (`server/src/channels/attachment-parts.ts`) appends
 * `[attachment truncated at 120000 characters]` to what it sends, so the model is never left
 * answering questions about a file it read only part of without knowing. That is half the promise.
 * The other half is not kept: this ceiling is 120,000 while `MAX_FILE_BYTES` above is 1,048,576, so
 * a 1 MB CSV is accepted at pick time, uploaded whole, shown as a `1.0MB` tile — and then read by
 * the model as roughly its first eighth, with nothing anywhere in the UI saying so. Somebody who
 * asks "how many rows have status=failed" gets a confident answer about the part that fit.
 *
 * That is a real gap and it is recorded rather than fixed here, because the fix is a composer
 * change and this file is only where the number lives. What the composer needs is already exported:
 * a file whose SIZE IN BYTES exceeds this constant may be truncated, and one at or under it cannot
 * be. That direction is exact rather than approximate — UTF-8 spends at least one byte per code
 * point, so a file of N bytes can never decode to more than N characters — which makes
 * `file.size > MAX_EXTRACTED_CHARACTERS` a warning that never fires on a file that will arrive
 * whole. It is deliberately a "may", since the same byte count is fewer characters in any script
 * that costs more than a byte each.

/**
 * Whether a paste is an attachment or an ordinary text paste.
 *
 * Text wins whenever the clipboard carries any. A file is ours only when there is no text to
 * prefer.
 *
 * This is the one rule here that is NOT T3 Code's. Theirs claims an image even when text came with
 * it, on the reasoning that an image is unambiguously what was meant. It is not: copying a cell
 * from a spreadsheet, or a block from a word processor, puts an `image/png` rendering of the
 * selection on the clipboard ALONGSIDE the text. Under "an image always wins" that paste attached a
 * screenshot of the cell and typed nothing — verified in Chrome against the real app, not
 * theorised.
 *
 * A screenshot carries no text at all, so the case this rule exists for is untouched.
 *
 * DECLINING A PASTE IS NOT THE SAME AS THE TEXT BEING TYPED, AND FOR SOME SOURCES IT IS NOT WHAT
 * HAPPENS. This function only says "not ours". What the paste then does is PromptArea's rule, and
 * that rule is: if the clipboard carries an image AND the `text/html` is Microsoft Office markup —
 * it looks for `urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office`, a `ProgId` name, a `Mso` class, or an `mso-*`
 * property — the text is inserted and the image ignored. Anything else with an image on the
 * clipboard calls `onImagePaste` and RETURNS, having already called `preventDefault` and inserted
 * nothing.
 *
 * So the two halves of the spreadsheet case land differently, and it is worth being exact about
 * which is which:
 *
 *   - Word and Excel put Office markup in the `text/html`. Their text is typed. Handled.
 *   - Google Sheets, Numbers, and every other source that behaves like Office without being it,
 *     take the second branch. Their IMAGE is attached and THEIR TEXT IS NOT TYPED — the same
 *     outcome "an image always wins" gave, arrived at by a different route.
 *
 * That second bullet is a known defect and is being kept for now rather than fixed, so this comment
 * says so instead of implying the spreadsheet case is covered. Fixing it means teaching this rule
 * or PromptArea's the difference between an image that IS the selection and an image that merely
 * accompanies it, which no clipboard flag reports.
 *
 * The other trade-off, stated because it is also real: copying an image from a web page can put the
 * image's URL in `text/plain`, and that pastes the URL rather than attaching the image. Drag or the
 * `+` button still attach it, and a URL landing in the box is visible and undoable — where a
 * swallowed paste is neither.
