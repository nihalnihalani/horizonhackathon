 * apologises for work it could have done. That is what happened to the built-in agents, which knew

/**
 * Where an answer came from, said out loud.
 *
 * Asked "a customer made 12 cash deposits just under the reporting threshold, what is our
 * obligation", the compliance Bot answered at length and with confidence: file a SAR, $5,000 or
 * more, within 30 calendar days of initial detection, retain for 5 years. The audit trail for that
 * turn holds one row, the routing decision. No tool call, no source, and no sentence anywhere saying
 * the answer came from the model rather than from anything this deployment can reach.
 *
 * Several of those numbers may well be right, and that is the problem. A confident, plausible,
 * unsourced answer is indistinguishable from a confident, plausible, wrong one, and nothing marked
 * the difference on a question about whether to file, against what threshold, inside what deadline.
 *
 * One package's `knowledge` Bot had a rule against exactly this, written into its YAML by whoever
 * happened to think of it. The Bot whose whole subject is regulatory obligation did not, because
 * `remote-ag-ui` gets its role description and nothing else. A rule that important sitting in one
 * agent's YAML is a rule that will be missing from the next agent somebody adds, so it lives here
 * and every Bot gets it.
 *
 * The last paragraph is not padding. An earlier attempt at this told Bots to go and find a source,
 * and they went hunting the open web and looped on a government 404 page, which is worse than the
 * problem: an unsourced answer marked as unsourced is honest, and a hunt for one is a Bot that
 * never answers. The instruction is to say where the answer came from, not to go looking.

 * What a tool call is given when its answer never came.
 *
 * A tool call the surface owns ends the run without a result on purpose: the surface draws it, or
 * puts it to a person, and starts the next run carrying the answer. When nobody answers — a Bot asks
 * for the wheel to get past a sign-in and the person decides they do not need it after all — no
 * answer is ever carried, and the call stays in the history with nothing following it.
 *
 * Providers reject that outright on the NEXT turn: "an assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be
 * followed by tool messages responding to each 'tool_call_id'". So the conversation is not merely
 * stuck on that one request, it is finished, and the only escape is starting a new one.
 *
 * Written for the model rather than for a log, because the model is the only reader: it has to
 * understand the call is over and not worth waiting for, and be able to say something useful about
 * it. "Nothing happened" would leave it repeating the request, and a fake success would have it
 * report work it never did.
 *
 * Shared because both Bots in this repo have to say the same thing. The first fix for this landed in
 * `agent-langgraph` alone, and `agent-bot` — the Bot that ships in the box, and the one behind the
 * Browser Bot — went on failing in exactly the same way until somebody drove it.
