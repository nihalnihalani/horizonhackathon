/**
 * The local stand-in for the routines CronJob: `server/scripts/fire-routines.ts`, looped.
 *
 * That script runs one sweep and exits — a CronJob outside the process is what makes it recurring,
 * and a failed run is meant to page somebody. A laptop running the dev stack has no CronJob around
 * it, so this file supplies the recurrence itself, in-process, by importing the very same sweep
 * (`offerDueRoutines`, `dispatchClaimedRoutines`) and the same stores/queue construction. It never
 * spawns the script as a child process — shelling out to run it every 30 seconds would be a second,
 * divergent implementation of what a sweep is, with its own bugs to keep in sync with the first.
 *
 * WHY THIS LOOP MUST NOT DIE ON THE FIRST DB BLIP, unlike the script it wraps: `fire-routines.ts`
 * lets a phase's exception propagate so the CronJob's run is marked failed and a person is paged —
 * that is correct there, because a fresh pod is one `kubectl` restart away and paging is cheap
 * compared to routines silently going stale. This process has no restart policy watching it; it is
 * somebody's laptop, left running. A worker that exited because Postgres hiccuped for two seconds
 * would need a human to notice and restart it, which is worse than a worker that logs the failure and
 * tries again on the next tick. So every phase below gets its own try/catch, and nothing here ever
 * lets a phase's error reach the top and take the process down.
