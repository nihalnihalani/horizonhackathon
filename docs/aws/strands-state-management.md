# State Management

A Strands agent carries state in three forms, each with its own lifetime and job:

1. **Conversation history:** the sequence of messages between the user and the agent.
2. **Agent state:** key-value data that lives outside the conversation context and
persists across requests.
3. **Invocation state:** contextual data that lives for a single invocation.

Knowing which one to reach for is what lets you keep context across multi-turn
interactions without leaking data into the model’s prompt when you don’t want it there.

## Conversation History

[Section titled “Conversation History”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#conversation-history)

Conversation history is the primary form of context in a Strands agent. You read
it directly off the agent:

- [Python](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-0-0)
- [TypeScript](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-0-1)

```
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent

agent = Agent()

# Send a message and get a response

agent("Hello!")

# Access the conversation history

print(agent.messages)  # Shows all messages exchanged so far
```

```
// Create an agent

const agent = new Agent()

// Send a message and get a response

await agent.invoke('Hello!')

// Access the conversation history

console.log(agent.messages) // Shows all messages exchanged so far
```

`agent.messages` contains every user and assistant message, including tool calls and
tool results. It’s the primary way to inspect what happened in a conversation.

Initialize an agent with existing messages to continue a prior conversation or
pre-fill its context:

- [Python](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-1-0)
- [TypeScript](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-1-1)

```
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent with initial messages

agent = Agent(messages=[\
\
    {"role": "user", "content": [{"text": "Hello, my name is Strands!"}]},\
\
    {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"text": "Hi there! How can I help you today?"}]}\
\
])

# Continue the conversation

agent("What's my name?")
```

```
// Create an agent with initial messages

const agent = new Agent({

  messages: [\
\
    { role: 'user', content: [{ text: 'Hello, my name is Strands!' }] },\
\
    { role: 'assistant', content: [{ text: 'Hi there! How can I help you today?' }] },\
\
  ],

})

// Continue the conversation

await agent.invoke("What's my name?")
```

Strands manages conversation history for you. It:

- Persists it between calls to the agent
- Sends it to the model on each inference
- Supplies it as context for tool execution
- Trims it to stay within the model’s context window

### Direct Tool Calling

[Section titled “Direct Tool Calling”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#direct-tool-calling)

Direct tool calls are (by default) recorded in the conversation history:

- [Python](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-2-0)
- [TypeScript](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-2-1)

```
from strands import Agent

from strands.vended_tools import notebook

agent = Agent(tools=[notebook])

# Direct tool call with recording (default behavior)

agent.tool.notebook(mode="create", name="ideas", new_str="# Project ideas")

# Direct tool call without recording

agent.tool.notebook(mode="list", record_direct_tool_call=False)

print(agent.messages)
```

The first `agent.tool.notebook()` call lands in the conversation history. The second
does not, because it passes `record_direct_tool_call=False`.

```
import { Agent } from '@strands-agents/sdk'

import { notebook } from '@strands-agents/sdk/vended-tools/notebook'

const agent = new Agent({

  tools: [notebook],

})

// notebook is registered when the agent is created, so the non-null assertion is safe.

await agent.tool.notebook!.invoke({ mode: 'list' })

const recordedMessageCount = agent.messages.length

await agent.tool.notebook!.invoke({ mode: 'list' }, { recordDirectToolCall: false })

console.log(recordedMessageCount > 0) // true

console.log(agent.messages.length === recordedMessageCount) // true
```

### Conversation Manager

[Section titled “Conversation Manager”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#conversation-manager)

A conversation manager keeps the history within the model’s context window. The
default, [`SlidingWindowConversationManager`](https://strandsagents.com/docs/api/python/strands.agent.conversation_manager.sliding_window_conversation_manager/#SlidingWindowConversationManager),
keeps recent messages and drops older ones when the window fills:

- [Python](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-3-0)
- [TypeScript](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-3-1)

```
from strands import Agent

from strands.agent.conversation_manager import SlidingWindowConversationManager

# Create a conversation manager with custom window size

# By default, SlidingWindowConversationManager is used even if not specified

conversation_manager = SlidingWindowConversationManager(

    window_size=10,  # Maximum number of message pairs to keep

)

# Use the conversation manager with your agent

agent = Agent(conversation_manager=conversation_manager)
```

```
import { SlidingWindowConversationManager } from '@strands-agents/sdk'

// Create a conversation manager with custom window size

// By default, SlidingWindowConversationManager is used even if not specified

const conversationManager = new SlidingWindowConversationManager({

  windowSize: 10,

})

const agent = new Agent({

  conversationManager,

})
```

The sliding window conversation manager:

- Keeps the most recent N message pairs
- Removes the oldest messages when the window size is exceeded
- Handles context window overflow exceptions by reducing context
- Ensures conversations don’t exceed model context limits

See [Conversation Management](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/conversation-management/) for more information about conversation managers.

## Agent State

[Section titled “Agent State”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#agent-state)

Agent state (also called app state) gives you key-value storage that lives outside the
conversation context. Strands does not pass it to the model during inference, but your
tools and application logic can read and modify it freely.

### Basic Usage

[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#basic-usage)

- [Python](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-4-0)
- [TypeScript](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-4-1)

```
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent with initial state

agent = Agent(state={"user_preferences": {"theme": "dark"}, "session_count": 0})

# Access state values

theme = agent.state.get("user_preferences")

print(theme)  # {"theme": "dark"}

# Set new state values

agent.state.set("last_action", "login")

agent.state.set("session_count", 1)

# Get entire state

all_state = agent.state.get()

print(all_state)  # All state data as a dictionary

# Delete state values

agent.state.delete("last_action")
```

```
// Create an agent with initial state

const agent = new Agent({

  appState: { user_preferences: { theme: 'dark' }, session_count: 0 },

})

// Access state values

const theme = agent.appState.get('user_preferences')

console.log(theme) // { theme: 'dark' }

// Set new state values

agent.appState.set('last_action', 'login')

agent.appState.set('session_count', 1)

// Get state values individually

console.log(agent.appState.get('user_preferences'))

console.log(agent.appState.get('session_count'))

// Delete state values

agent.appState.delete('last_action')
```

### State Validation and Safety

[Section titled “State Validation and Safety”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#state-validation-and-safety)

Agent state enforces JSON serialization validation to ensure data can be persisted and restored:

- [Python](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-5-0)
- [TypeScript](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-5-1)

```
from strands import Agent

agent = Agent()

# Valid JSON-serializable values

agent.state.set("string_value", "hello")

agent.state.set("number_value", 42)

agent.state.set("boolean_value", True)

agent.state.set("list_value", [1, 2, 3])

agent.state.set("dict_value", {"nested": "data"})

agent.state.set("null_value", None)

# Invalid values will raise ValueError

try:

    agent.state.set("function", lambda x: x)  # Not JSON serializable

except ValueError as e:

    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

```
const agent = new Agent()

// Valid JSON-serializable values

agent.appState.set('string_value', 'hello')

agent.appState.set('number_value', 42)

agent.appState.set('boolean_value', true)

agent.appState.set('list_value', [1, 2, 3])

agent.appState.set('dict_value', { nested: 'data' })

agent.appState.set('null_value', null)

// Invalid values will raise an error

try {

  agent.appState.set('function', () => 'test') // Not JSON serializable

} catch (error) {

  console.log(`Error: ${error}`)

}
```

### Using State in Tools

[Section titled “Using State in Tools”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#using-state-in-tools)

Agent state is particularly useful for maintaining information across tool executions:

- [Python](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-6-0)
- [TypeScript](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-6-1)

```
from strands import Agent, tool, ToolContext

@tool(context=True)

def track_user_action(action: str, tool_context: ToolContext):

    """Track user actions in agent state.

    Args:

        action: The action to track

    """

    # Get current action count

    action_count = tool_context.agent.state.get("action_count") or 0

    # Update state

    tool_context.agent.state.set("action_count", action_count + 1)

    tool_context.agent.state.set("last_action", action)

    return f"Action '{action}' recorded. Total actions: {action_count + 1}"

@tool(context=True)

def get_user_stats(tool_context: ToolContext):

    """Get user statistics from agent state."""

    action_count = tool_context.agent.state.get("action_count") or 0

    last_action = tool_context.agent.state.get("last_action") or "none"

    return f"Actions performed: {action_count}, Last action: {last_action}"

# Create agent with tools

agent = Agent(tools=[track_user_action, get_user_stats])

# Use tools that modify and read state

agent("Track that I logged in")

agent("Track that I viewed my profile")

print(f"Actions taken: {agent.state.get('action_count')}")

print(f"Last action: {agent.state.get('last_action')}")
```

```
const trackUserActionTool = tool({

  name: 'track_user_action',

  description: 'Track user actions in agent state',

  inputSchema: z.object({

    action: z.string().describe('The action to track'),

  }),

  callback: (input, context?: ToolContext) => {

    if (!context) {

      throw new Error('Context is required')

    }

    // Get current action count

    const actionCount = (context.agent.appState.get('action_count') as number) || 0

    // Update state

    context.agent.appState.set('action_count', actionCount + 1)

    context.agent.appState.set('last_action', input.action)

    return `Action '${input.action}' recorded. Total actions: ${actionCount + 1}`

  },

})

const getUserStatsTool = tool({

  name: 'get_user_stats',

  description: 'Get user statistics from agent state',

  inputSchema: z.object({}),

  callback: (input, context?: ToolContext) => {

    if (!context) {

      throw new Error('Context is required')

    }

    const actionCount = (context.agent.appState.get('action_count') as number) || 0

    const lastAction = (context.agent.appState.get('last_action') as string) || 'none'

    return `Actions performed: ${actionCount}, Last action: ${lastAction}`

  },

})

// Create agent with tools

const agent = new Agent({

  tools: [trackUserActionTool, getUserStatsTool],

})

// Use tools that modify and read state

await agent.invoke('Track that I logged in')

await agent.invoke('Track that I viewed my profile')

console.log(`Actions taken: ${agent.appState.get('action_count')}`)

console.log(`Last action: ${agent.appState.get('last_action')}`)
```

## Invocation State

[Section titled “Invocation State”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#invocation-state)

Each agent interaction maintains an invocation state dictionary that persists across the
agent loop cycles and is **not** included in the agent’s context:

- [Python](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-7-0)
- [TypeScript](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#tab-panel-7-1)

```
from strands import Agent, tool, ToolContext

@tool(context=True)

def whoami(tool_context: ToolContext) -> str:

    """Return the user ID carried in the invocation state."""

    user_id = tool_context.invocation_state.get("user_id", "unknown")

    return f"Current user: {user_id}"

agent = Agent(tools=[whoami])

# Pass per-invocation state when invoking. Hooks and tools read and

# mutate it during the invocation.

result = agent("Who am I?", invocation_state={"request_id": "r-42", "user_id": "u-1"})
```

```
const agent = new Agent()

// Pass per-invocation state when invoking

const result = await agent.invoke('Hi there!', {

  invocationState: { requestId: 'r-42', userId: 'u-1' },

})

// Hooks and tools can read and mutate invocationState during

// the invocation. The same object is returned on the result.

console.log(result.invocationState)

// { requestId: 'r-42', userId: 'u-1', ... }
```

Invocation state (`invocation_state``invocationState`):

- Comes from the `invocation_state``invocationState` argument you pass to the invocation, and defaults to `{}` when omitted
- Persists through the recursive agent loop cycles within a single invocation
- Is shared by reference across all hook events and tools, so mutations are visible to later hooks and tools in the same invocation
- Surfaces on the result: TypeScript returns the full invocation state as `result.invocationState`; Python returns its `request_state` slot as `result.state`
- Is **not** included in the agent’s model context

## Persisting State Across Sessions

[Section titled “Persisting State Across Sessions”](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/state/#persisting-state-across-sessions)

For automatic persistence of agent state and conversation history across application restarts, see [Session Management](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/session-management/). For manual, point-in-time capture and restore of agent state, see [Snapshots](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/sdk/agents/snapshots/).
